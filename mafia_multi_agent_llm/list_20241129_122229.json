"system : Night1 start"
"system : You are the mafia. Choose a player to kill. (one word, no speaker label)"
"system : Michael selected Emil, Alexandra selected Lucian"
"system : Two mafia select other target. Debate with other mafia about selecting target. If debate ends, please remain silent until instructed by the system."
"Michael : I think we should eliminate Emil. He seems like a good target since he's actively trying to engage the group."
"Alexandra : I see your point, but what if Emil turns out to be the Doctor or the Police? That could complicate things for us later. How about we stick with Lucian for tonight? We can always reassess later."
"Michael : I understand your concern, but I still believe eliminating Emil is a safer choice. We can always reevaluate our strategy if needed, but I think he's a bigger threat based on his enthusiasm."
"Alexandra : I understand your perspective, but I still think Lucian might be a less risky choice. He's been quieter and could be less noticeable. Let's go with that for now and keep an eye on Emil for the next round."
"Michael : Alright, let's go with Lucian then. I trust your judgment for tonight."

"Vladimir : Selene"
"system : Selene is not mafia"
"system : Day2 start"
"system : Selene dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Michael : It's unfortunate that Selene was eliminated during the night. We need to stay focused and figure out who might be the Mafia among us. Have any of you noticed anything suspicious in the discussions so far?"
"Vladimir : I think we should analyze how everyone reacted to Selene's elimination. It might give us clues about their identities. Has anyone felt suspicious about any particular player or their voting patterns?"
"Viktor : I agree with Vladimir. We should pay close attention to how everyone reacted to Selene's elimination. Let's share our observations and see if we can identify any suspicious behavior or alliances that might point to the Mafia among us."
"Lucian : I think it's important to consider how each of us reacted to Selene's elimination. Let's not jump to conclusions too quickly, but I feel we should keep an eye on those who seem overly eager to shift the blame or divert attention. What do others think?"
"Michael : I agree with Lucian. It's essential to stay vigilant and analyze everyone's behavior, especially those who seem eager to deflect blame. We should be careful not to overlook who might be working to protect themselves while trying to shift focus."
"Vladimir : I find it interesting that Selene was eliminated. I've been listening closely, and I think we should consider how we discuss our suspicions. I'm keeping an eye on players who may have been a bit too eager in their suggestions. Let's ensure we carefully evaluate everyone's behavior to uncover any potential Mafia connections."
"Michael : I think we should consider voting for anyone who has been overly defensive or hasn't contributed much to the discussion. It's crucial to identify those who may be trying to fly under the radar."
"Vladimir : I think we should consider casting our votes against those who have been silent or evasive in our discussions. It's crucial to target anyone who seems to be trying to avoid drawing attention to themselves, as they could be trying to blend in with the Citizens."
"Lucian : I believe we should discuss our suspicions further before voting. It's crucial to analyze who has been leading the accusations and if their motives align with protecting the Citizens. Let's make sure our decision is well thought out."
"Viktor : I think we should take a moment to reflect on everyone's contributions before making a vote. It's essential to identify any players who seem unusually quiet or defensive. Let's consider what we've discussed and make a fair decision based on our observations."
"system : It's time to vote!"
"system : Vote result is{'Vladimir': ['Emil'], 'Lucian': [], 'Michael': [], 'Viktor': ['Lucian', 'Alexandra'], 'Emil': ['Vladimir', 'Michael', 'Viktor'], 'Alexandra': []}"
"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Emil : I understand that emotions can run high after Selene's elimination, but I assure you I'm just a Citizen trying to identify the true Mafia among us. I've been actively participating and sharing my thoughts to contribute to our discussions. Please consider my contributions and let's focus on finding the real threats instead of eliminating someone who is working towards our shared goal."
"system : It's time for final vote!"
"system : Final result is {'y': ['Vladimir', 'Lucian', 'Michael', 'Viktor', 'Alexandra'], 'n': []}.\nEmil executed!Emil was a citizen!"

"Michael : I still think Viktor would be a safer target. He has been quite vocal and might pose a bigger threat to us."
"Alexandra : I understand your concern, but I still believe we should target Vladimir tonight. He has been quite active and may pose a bigger threat if he continues to gather information and keep the group focused."
"Michael : Let's go with Viktor then. I agree he could be a liability for us if he continues to push for votes and gather support."
