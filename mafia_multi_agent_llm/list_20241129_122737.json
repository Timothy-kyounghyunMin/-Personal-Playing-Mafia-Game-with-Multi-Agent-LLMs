"system : Two mafia select other target. Debate with other mafia about selecting target. If debate ends, please remain silent until instructed by the system."
"Emil : I think we should stick with targeting Kraven since I initially chose him. It would be risky to switch to Viktor at this point, especially since Alexandra already targeted him. We need a consensus to keep it clean and avoid suspicion. What do you think?"
"Alexandra : I agree with you, Emil. Let's stick with Kraven since it makes sense to follow through with your initial choice. Keeping it consistent will help us avoid drawing unnecessary attention."

"Viktor : We should consider who was most active in discussions with Kraven before he was eliminated. Did anyone else notice any unusual behavior from specific players? Let's break down our impressions to help pinpoint any suspects among us."
"Viktor : I believe we should focus on those who were vocal in the discussions surrounding Kraven. There might have been signs of protection or accusations that could suggest alliances. Has anyone noticed any odd interactions that could point to someone being Mafia?"
"Viktor : I think we should consider the votes and discussions around Kraven before he was eliminated. It might reveal players who were trying to steer the conversation away from him or protect him. Let's review who seemed to align with Kraven or downplay any suspicions about him."
"Viktor : I propose we analyze the players who were actively discussing or voting against Kraven. Those interactions might give us a clearer view of who might have been aligned with the Mafia. Let's also consider how everyone has reacted to Kraven's elimination; it could provide valuable clues."
"Viktor : I think we should vote now to eliminate someone we suspect might be part of the Mafia. I propose we consider someone who was particularly vocal or tried to lead the discussion away from Kraven. Let's gather our votes and see where everyone stands."
"Viktor : I vote to eliminate Marius, as I feel he was trying to steer the conversation without providing substantial insights."
"Viktor : I vote to eliminate Marius, as I feel he was trying to steer the conversation without providing substantial insights."
"Viktor : I vote to eliminate Marius, as I believe he has been trying to deflect suspicion and hasn't contributed enough to our discussions."

If I'm eliminated, you may lose a valuable ally in this game. I encourage you to reconsider and look at the overall dynamics, as there may be others who have raised more red flags. Please think about who has been steering the conversation away from crucial discussions rather than focusing solely on me."

"Viktor : Vladimir's elimination is concerning, and we need to consider who was most vocal against him prior to his death. Let's analyze the behaviors and alliances that may have formed in the days leading up to this. We should focus on anyone who might have seemed eager to deflect attention or mislead us during discussions. What are everyone's thoughts on the recent interactions?"
"Viktor : We need to reflect on who was engaging with Vladimir before his elimination. We should also consider any patterns in voting that indicate who might be working together. It\u2019s crucial we identify possible Mafia members quickly. What are our observations?"
"Viktor : We need to focus on who last interacted with Vladimir and if anyone tried to defend him or shift the blame. Let's analyze those conversations because they might give us insight into the Mafia's movements. What does everyone think?"
"Viktor : We should consider how Marius and Semira reacted to Vladimir's accusations and discussions. It's essential to analyze their responses and ensure we don't eliminate another Citizen by mistake. What do others think about the current dynamics?"
"Viktor : I believe we should consider voting out Marius again, as he has managed to avoid elimination despite the suspicions surrounding him. His previous statements seemed evasive and may indicate he is trying to blend in as a Citizen. Let's see who agrees with me on this approach."
"Viktor : I vote to eliminate Marius again, as I'm still suspicious of his intentions and behavior in our discussions."
"Viktor : I vote to eliminate Marius. His evasive behavior and attempts to deflect suspicion raise red flags for me."
"Viktor : I vote to eliminate Marius. His behavior continues to seem suspicious, and I believe he could be one of the Mafia members."
"Viktor : I vote to eliminate Marius. His behavior remains suspicious, and I believe he could be trying to mislead us as part of the Mafia."

I've been trying to contribute to our discussions and help identify the Mafia. If you eliminate me, you might be losing a valuable ally in this fight. I urge you to reconsider and look closely at those who are pointing fingers and not providing substantial evidence. Don't act in haste; let's truly analyze who we suspect."
