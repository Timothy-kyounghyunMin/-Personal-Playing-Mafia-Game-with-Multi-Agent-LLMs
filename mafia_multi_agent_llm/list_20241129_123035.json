"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Marius : It's unfortunate that Ileana was eliminated during the night. We need to take this opportunity to discuss and figure out who among us might be part of the Mafia. I suggest we share any observations or suspicions we have so far. Who does everyone think is acting suspiciously?"
"Marius : I think we should consider who was more vocal during our discussions yesterday and any potential alliances that might have formed. Does anyone have any observations about player interactions that stood out to them? It's crucial we gather as much information as we can to identify the Mafia."
"Marius : I observed that Ileana was quite involved in our discussions, and her absence could change the dynamics. It might be worth looking at those who may have disagreed with her or were avoiding engaging with her points. Does anyone recall specific interactions that seemed off?"
"Marius : I also noticed that Semira seemed quite involved during our discussions. They might have insights about this situation. What do you think, Semira? Did you notice anything that could help us identify the Mafia?"
"Marius : I believe it's important for us to focus on the interactions we've had so far. I suggest we consider Dragos' and Semira's responses during the discussions yesterday. Did either of you notice anything suspicious or any players who might not have been genuine in their contributions?"
"Marius : I think it might be time to vote for someone based on our discussions. From my observations, I have a suspicion that Radu might not be as forthcoming as the rest of us. I'm leaning towards voting for him. What does everyone else think?"
"Marius : I still feel that we should consider the evidence we've gathered and vote strategically. Based on my suspicions, I am going to vote for Radu. I believe it could be a potential move to help identify the Mafia."
"Marius : I will vote for Radu. I believe his behavior has raised some suspicions among us. Let's see where this leads us."
"Marius : I will vote for Radu."
"Marius : I will vote for Radu."
"system : It's time to vote!"

"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Radu : I've been actively participating in our discussions and providing my thoughts on the situation. I understand that suspicions can arise, especially with Ileana's elimination. However, I believe that targeting me may not be the best move for the group. I've been honest in my contributions and am committed to uncovering the Mafia alongside all of you. I urge you to reconsider your votes and focus on identifying the true suspects among us."
