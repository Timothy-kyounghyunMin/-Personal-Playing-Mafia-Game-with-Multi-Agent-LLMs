"Emil : I'm Emil, a citizen in this game. I'm here to work with all of you to identify the Mafia and ensure our safety. Let's keep our discussions open and logical as we navigate through this challenge together!"
"Selene : I'm Selene, a citizen in this game. I look forward to collaborating with all of you to identify the Mafia members and keep our community safe. Let\u2019s stay observant and work together!"

"system : Ileana selected Lucian, Vladimir selected Andrei"
"system : Two mafia select other target. Debate with other mafia about selecting target. If debate ends, please remain silent until instructed by the system."
"Ileana : I think we should reconsider our targets. Lucian seems to be gathering a lot of support with his citizen approach, and if he continues to stay safe, he could become a problem later. However, I also see the potential in targeting Andrei. His eagerness to identify the Mafia might make him too convincing if we give him the chance to lead others. What do you think?"
"Vladimir : I agree with you, targeting Lucian makes more sense. His growing support could make him a significant threat. Let's go for him instead."
"Ileana : Agreed. Let's commit to eliminating Lucian."

"system : Day2 start"
"system : Lucian dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Emil : I'm deeply concerned about Lucian's death. We need to analyze the discussions from yesterday and see if anyone's behavior stood out, as it might give us clues about the Mafia. Let's share our thoughts on who we think might be suspicious!"
"Emil : Lucian's elimination is troubling, and I think we should scrutinize everyone's reactions to it closely. Did anyone notice if a particular player was overly defensive or aggressive in their responses to accusations yesterday? It might help us identify potential Mafia members. Let's share our observations!"
"Emil : I think we should pay close attention to how each one of us responded to Lucian's death. Did anyone express relief or seem unconcerned? Those reactions could indicate someone's connection to the Mafia. Let's discuss our thoughts and suspicions openly."
"Emil : I noticed that after Lucian's death, there seems to be a lack of urgency in some players to investigate further. Let's be careful about who we trust and make sure we aren't being misled. I suggest we focus on those who haven't been as vocal in discussions so far, as they could be hiding their true roles."
"Emil : I suggest we carefully consider voting for someone who has been less active in our discussions. It's important to shine a light on those who might be hiding among us. I have my suspicions about a couple of players, and I'll share more if we continue to discuss."
"Emil : I believe we should consider voting for someone who has been relatively quiet in our discussions. Selene, Andrei, what are your thoughts on this? Have you noticed anything suspicious or unusual in the way players are interacting?"
"Emil : I think we need to consider voting for those who have been quieter. I've observed that Andrei and Ileana haven't contributed much to the discussion today. It might be worth discussing our suspicions regarding them further. What do you all think?"
"Emil : I think we should consider voting for Andrei. His contributions have been minimal, and I find it suspicious. Let's discuss this further before we vote."
"Emil : I think it's important to consider voting for Andrei based on his lack of engagement. However, I would like to hear from the others before making a final decision. What do you all think?"
"Emil : I think we should proceed with voting for Andrei. His lack of participation raises suspicions, and I believe it's time for action. Let's see how the votes turn out."
"system : It's time to vote!"
"system : Vote result is{'Emil': ['Andrei'], 'Selene': [], 'Ileana': [], 'Andrei': ['Emil', 'Selene', 'Ileana', 'Alexandra', 'Vladimir'], 'Alexandra': [], 'Vladimir': []}"
"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Andrei : I understand there are concerns about my engagement in discussions, but I assure you that I am a citizen just like the rest of you. Every action taken by the Mafia is crucial to recognize, and voting for me might not be the best course of action. Please reconsider your suspicions and think about how we can work together to identify the true Mafia members. Let's focus on gathering more information before making a final decision."
"system : It's time for final vote!"
"system : Final result is {'y': ['Emil', 'Selene', 'Ileana', 'Alexandra', 'Vladimir'], 'n': []}.\nAndrei executed!Andrei was a citizen!"
