"Viktor : Hello everyone, I'm Viktor. I'm a Citizen, and I'm here to work with you all to identify and eliminate any Mafia members among us. Let's stay alert and collaborate to make wise decisions throughout the game."
"Larisa : Hello everyone, I'm Larisa. I\u2019m also a Citizen, and I\u2019m looking forward to working together to uncover any Mafia members among us. Let's keep our eyes open and share our thoughts during discussions!"

"system : Stefan selected Viktor, Cristina selected Vladimir"
"system : Two mafia select other target. Debate with other mafia about selecting target. If debate ends, please remain silent until instructed by the system."
"Stefan : I think we should focus on Viktor since he seems to be gaining trust among the players. If we eliminate him early, it might create confusion and suspicion among the others. What do you think?"
"Cristina : I see your point, but I believe eliminating Vladimir would be a better choice. He seems eager and engaged, which might make him a bigger threat later on. Plus, he might draw attention away from us. What do you think about focusing on him instead?"
"Stefan : I understand your perspective, but I still think Viktor is a safer choice. He's already trying to build trust, and taking him out could create chaos. Let's go with Viktor this time and see how things unfold. We can always reassess later."
"Cristina : Okay, let's go with Viktor then."
"Stefan : Viktor"
"Cristina : Viktor"
"Stefan : Night phase complete."
"Cristina : Night phase complete."
"Stefan : It's day time now. Let's discuss who we believe could be Mafia among us. It's important that we share our thoughts and observations."
"Cristina : I think we should keep an eye on Viktor. He was very vocal during introductions and might be trying to gain our trust. It's possible he's trying to appear as a strong Citizen to deflect suspicion later on. What does everyone else think?"

"system : Mafia shot Larisa, but doctor save Larisa!"
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Viktor : It's great to see that Larisa was saved. This shows that we have a Doctor among us, which is a relief. We need to use this opportunity to discuss our suspicions. I would like to hear what everyone thinks about who might be the Mafia. Has anyone noticed anything suspicious during our previous discussions or votes?"
"Viktor : It's important to analyze our previous discussions and voting patterns for any unusual behavior. Did anyone notice something specific that stood out to them? Let's share any suspicions we have so we can narrow down our choices together."
"Viktor : It's important for us to be cautious. I suggest we focus on those who have been contributing less or acting defensively. We should also keep an eye on any votes that seemed suspicious or uncharacteristic. Who does everyone think we should look into first?"
"Viktor : I think we should discuss Emil, as he indicated he is the Doctor, which could be a strategic move to gain trust. While he did save Larisa, it might also provide him cover as Mafia. What do others think about this?"
"Viktor : I understand the concern about Emil, but I think we should also consider how others are interacting with him. We should analyze everyone's behavior, not just focus on one player. I'm interested in hearing thoughts about Stefan's contributions. He's been relatively neutral in our discussions. What does everyone think about that?"
"Viktor : I believe we should keep scrutinizing Stefan's actions, as his neutral stance may be hiding something. I suggest we consider him as a possible suspect. What does everyone else think?"
"Viktor : I think we should definitely keep an eye on Stefan and investigate further. If we can gather more evidence against him, it might help us in deciding who to vote for. Let's discuss this openly and see if others share similar concerns about him or if there are other suspicions we should explore."
"Viktor : I believe we should proceed with a vote to eliminate someone we suspect. Based on our discussions, I think Stefan is worth considering for elimination. His lack of strong contributions raises red flags. Are we all in agreement on this?"
"Viktor : I believe we should vote for Stefan based on our discussions and his neutral behavior. It's essential to eliminate potential Mafia members to protect our team."
"Viktor : I vote to eliminate Stefan based on our discussions and his neutral behavior."
"system : It's time to vote!"

"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Stefan : I understand why there may be suspicions about my behavior, but I assure you I am a Citizen, just like the rest of you. It's important to think carefully before making a decision that could eliminate an innocent player. We should focus on gathering more evidence rather than jumping to conclusions. Please reconsider your vote."
"system : It's time for final vote!"

"system : Two mafia select other target. Debate with other mafia about selecting target. If debate ends, please remain silent until instructed by the system."
"Cristina : I believe we should go with Viktor since he seems to be a strong player and has been vocal in discussions. Eliminating him could potentially help us maintain an advantage. What do you think?"
"Stefan : I understand your point about Viktor being a strong player, but I still believe Radu is a good choice. He is quieter and could easily slip under the radar if we keep him around. I think it might be safer to eliminate him. What do you think?"
"Cristina : I think we should stick with our plan to eliminate Viktor. His vocal presence makes him a target that could rally the group against us if he remains in the game. Let's go with Viktor."
"Stefan : Let's go with Viktor then."
"Cristina : Viktor"
"Stefan : Viktor"
"Cristina : Night phase complete."
"Stefan : It's now daytime. Let's discuss our next move and what we've observed so far. Who do we feel might be the next target, given that another player is still out there?"
"Cristina : I think we need to focus our suspicions on Larisa. She has been vocal and might try to sway the group against us. If we eliminate her, it could also shift the dynamics and lessen the trust among the remaining players. What does everyone else think?"
"Stefan : I agree with the idea of focusing on Larisa. Her vocal presence and ability to sway the group could pose a threat to us moving forward. If we eliminate her, it might also create some doubt among the remaining players, making them question each other's loyalties. Let's push for that."

"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Viktor : It's unfortunate that we lost Larisa. We need to take this seriously and analyze how she may have been targeted. I still feel that we need to look closely at Stefan, especially since we didn't eliminate him last time. If we can narrow down the suspects to include him or others, we might have a better chance this time. What do others think?"
"Viktor : We need to discuss Stefan again. Since he faced strong suspicion yesterday and was not eliminated, it's possible the Mafia may be protecting him. Also, we must consider the voting pattern from before. It's important to gather more insights from everyone before finalizing our suspicions. What do you all think?"
"Viktor : We really need to consider who might be working together. The vote yesterday showed a split, and I feel that Stefan is still a strong suspect. Let's share anything we've noticed about each other's behaviors since the last round. This will help us decide the next steps more effectively."
"Viktor : We should definitely consider voting for Stefan this round. His behavior still raises suspicion, and with Larisa being eliminated, we can't afford to let another potential Mafia member slip through. Let's be cautious and make a decision based on what we've observed. Who agrees?"
"Viktor : I believe we should vote for Stefan this round. His behavior continues to raise suspicions, and we can't afford to let another potential Mafia go unchecked. Let's move forward decisively this time."
"Viktor : I propose we vote for Stefan. His continued presence raises too many red flags, especially after the events of the last round and the elimination of Larisa. Let's make our decision and try to root out the Mafia."
"Viktor : I vote for Stefan."
"Viktor : I vote for Stefan."

"Stefan : I understand the suspicions surrounding me, but I assure you that I am a Citizen. It's important to consider that the true threat might be hiding among us, and eliminating me may not lead to the outcome you expect. I urge you to reconsider and evaluate the behaviors of others as well."

"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Viktor : It's unfortunate that we lost Emil. We know that Stefan was Mafia, which means we are getting closer to identifying the remaining threats. Now we should focus on the remaining players: Radu, Vladimir, and Cristina. I suggest we discuss Radu, as he has been less involved in the discussions. What does everyone think?"
"Viktor : I think we should critically evaluate Radu's behavior. He has been less vocal, and that could indicate something suspicious. Let's discuss any observations we have about him and see if we share similar concerns."
"Viktor : I believe we should focus on Radu, as his silence and lack of contribution raise concerns. Let's discuss his behavior and see if others have noticed anything suspicious about him."
"Viktor : I suggest we move forward and vote to eliminate Radu. His lack of participation and engagement in discussions makes him a prime suspect, especially after losing Emil. What does everyone else think?"
"Viktor : I vote for Radu."
"Viktor : I vote for Radu."
"Viktor : I vote for Radu."

"Radu : I understand the suspicions against me, but I am a Citizen, just like the rest of you. My quieter participation does not mean I have anything to hide. The focus should be on gathering evidence and analyzing everyone's actions, not just eliminating players based on their level of activity. I urge you to reconsider your vote and focus on finding the remaining Mafia member together."
