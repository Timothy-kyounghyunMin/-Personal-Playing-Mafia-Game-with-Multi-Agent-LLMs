"Kraven : I'm Kraven, and I'm here to figure out how to navigate this game and blend in with the Citizens while secretly working with my fellow Mafia member. Let's see who we can target tonight."
"Emil : I'm Emil, and I've taken on the role of the Police. My goal is to identify the Mafia members and ensure the Citizens' victory. I plan to use my investigations wisely and blend in with the group to keep my identity hidden for as long as necessary. Looking forward to working with everyone to uncover the truth."
"Semira : I'm Semira, a Citizen in this game. My aim is to work with everyone to figure out who the Mafia members are and help eliminate them. I'll be observing behaviors and voting based on suspicions, all while keeping my identity a secret to stay safe. Looking forward to collaborating with you all!"

"system : Kraven is mafia"
"system : Day2 start"
"system : Mafia shot Emil, but doctor save Emil!"
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Viktor : I\u2019m glad to see that Emil is still alive after the attempted elimination. I think we need to discuss who might have been targeting him and why. We should focus on identifying the behavior of those who might be trying to steer suspicion away from themselves."
"Viktor : We should analyze Emil's experience last night. It's possible that the Mafia targeted him because they perceived him as a threat due to his role as the Police. Let's also look at how everyone reacts and what suspicions arise during our discussion, as that might help us find the Mafia members."
"Viktor : I think it\u2019s crucial to examine any sudden accusations or attempts to divert suspicion that may arise now that Emil survived. We should also be cautious of anyone who seems too eager to point fingers today, as they might be trying to cover up their own involvement with the Mafia. Let\u2019s discuss everyone's observations and thoughts."
"Viktor : I believe we should revisit the players who have been less vocal or trying to blend in too much, as they may be hiding their Mafia roles. Let's hear more thoughts on who might be acting suspiciously today after Emil's near elimination."
"Viktor : I believe we should closely examine Kraven and Radu, as they seemed to be quite vague in their introductions. It's worth considering if they may be working with the Mafia to eliminate more Citizens. What do others think?"
"Viktor : I believe it would be wise to reconsider our voting choices and focus on those who seem to be drawing attention away from themselves, which could indicate they might be part of the Mafia. Let's keep our discussions open and logical as we prepare to vote."
"Viktor : I believe we should vote for Kraven based on his vague introduction and potential attempt to blend in with the Citizens. This suspicion, combined with the first night\u2019s events, makes him a strong candidate for the Mafia."
"Viktor : I vote for Kraven."
"Viktor : I vote for Kraven."

"Kraven : I understand that suspicions may arise, especially after the events of the previous night. However, I assure you that I am a Citizen trying to work collaboratively with everyone. It's easy to point fingers when emotions are high, but I urge you to consider all the evidence carefully before making your decision. Let's focus on the overall behavior of each player rather than jumping to conclusions."

"system : Day3 start"
"system : Semira dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Viktor : It's unfortunate to see Semira gone. We need to figure out why the Mafia targeted her. I suspect that her behavior may have made her a target, and we should analyze who was active in the discussions leading to her elimination. Let's dissect our options and keep our votes focused on anyone who seems to be driving suspicion away from themselves."
"Viktor : We need to consider who may have been trying to direct attention away from Semira recently. I believe we should focus on Radu, as he has not contributed much to the discussions. Let's discuss our suspicions and decide on a vote."
"Viktor : I think we should closely examine Radu and possibly vote for him. His lack of contribution raises suspicion, and we need to ensure that we are not letting any potential Mafia members escape our scrutiny. Let's gather thoughts and decide how to proceed."
"Viktor : I believe Radu should be our target for today\u2019s vote. His lack of active participation raises red flags, and we cannot afford to let potential Mafia members influence the group any longer. Let's consolidate our votes against him."

"Radu : I understand that my lack of participation may raise suspicion, but I assure you that I am also just trying to gather information and analyze everyone's behavior. It's easy to point fingers without concrete evidence, and I urge you to consider all the players' actions rather than focusing solely on my contributions. Let's think this through carefully before making a decision that could lead to further consequences for the Citizens."
