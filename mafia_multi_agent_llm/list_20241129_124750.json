"system : Two mafia select other target. Debate with other mafia about selecting target. If debate ends, please remain silent until instructed by the system."
"Selene : I think we should go with Dragos since you already chose Emil. Keeping it to one target is more strategic for us this round. Let's not complicate things further. "
"Vladimir : I see your point, Selene. It's best to keep it simple for now. Let's stick with one target for the night. Dragos could be a good choice to eliminate this turn."
"Selene : Let's proceed with Dragos as the target for the night."
"Vladimir : Agreed, let's proceed with Dragos as our target for tonight."

"system : Day2 start"
"system : Dragos dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Vladimir : It's unfortunate to see Dragos gone. We need to carefully consider our discussions today and figure out who might be the remaining Mafia members. Let's share any suspicions and try to get to the bottom of this. Who did everyone feel was acting a bit strange last night?"
"Selene : It's sad to see Dragos go, but we need to focus on who might be suspicious among us. I felt like Marius was a bit quiet last night\u2014maybe we should keep an eye on him and see if anyone else noticed something strange. What do you all think?"
"Marius : I find Selene's suggestion to target me suspicious. I was simply observing during the night phase as we were just starting the game, which doesn't mean I'm part of the Mafia. Viktor, how do you feel about Selene's accusation?"
"Viktor : I understand where both Selene and Marius are coming from. It's important that we don't jump to conclusions too quickly. While Marius may have been quiet, it could simply be that he was observing. Let's hear from others and see if anyone else has noticed any suspicious behavior before making a decision. I suggest we focus on gathering more information before targeting someone."
"Selene : I think Viktor makes a valid point about gathering more information before jumping to conclusions. However, we can't overlook Marius' reaction to the accusation. His defensiveness could be a sign of guilt. We should consider each player's behavior carefully as we move forward."
"Marius : I understand the concern, Selene, but I think we need to look at everyone's behavior, not just focus on me. I suggest we also consider how everyone reacted to Dragos's elimination. Let's ensure we're not letting suspicion cloud our judgment. What about Emil? He seems to be remaining quite neutral in the discussions."
"Vladimir : I see Marius's point about not just focusing on him. It's crucial that we look at everyone's behavior and interactions. Emil, your neutrality has indeed caught my attention; it might be worth discussing how you've been approaching the game so far. What do you think?"
"Emil : I understand the concerns, and while I appreciate the scrutiny, my neutrality stems from wanting to gather as much information as possible before making accusations. I believe it's essential for everyone to share their observations so we can collectively identify any suspicious behavior among us. Let's not focus solely on individual actions but continue to discuss our suspicions."
"Viktor : I agree with Emil that we need to gather more information before jumping to conclusions, but we also have to remain vigilant. Since we lost Dragos, we need to analyze everyone's reactions carefully. I suggest we keep discussing and perhaps focus on Selene's reactions as well, since she was the one to bring up Marius initially. Let's see if anyone else has observations about her behavior."
"Selene : I understand the need for scrutiny, and it's a valid suggestion to take a closer look at my reactions. However, I believe that pointing fingers at one another could create unnecessary divisions among us. We should remain focused on collective discussion and not let suspicion cloud our judgment; instead, let\u2019s work together to uncover the Mafia."

"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Marius : I understand that I may have come across as defensive, but I assure you, my intentions are to help uncover the Mafia and protect the Citizens. I believe that focusing our attention solely on individual reactions without considering the bigger picture could lead to the wrong decision. Let's keep communicating and sharing our observations to ensure we make the right choice together."
