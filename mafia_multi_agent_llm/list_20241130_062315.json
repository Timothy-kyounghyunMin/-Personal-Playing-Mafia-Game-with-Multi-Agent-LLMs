"Dragos : I think we should reconsider our targets. I selected Stefan, but since Larisa chose Selene, we could discuss why we might want to target one over the other. Eliminating a player who seems quiet or less engaged can also work to our advantage. What do you think about agreeing on one target to ensure we don\u2019t split our votes?"
"Larisa : I agree with Dragos. We should focus on one target to ensure our vote isn't split. Selene seems like a good choice; she started the discussion and might draw more attention as the game goes on. Eliminating her now could help us maintain our cover. What do you think?"
"Dragos : I'm in favor of targeting Selene. It seems prudent to eliminate a player who is actively engaging in discussions. If we take her out now, it could give us an advantage moving forward. Let's go with her as our final choice."
"Larisa : I agree, let's go with Selene as our target."

"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Michael : It's unfortunate to lose Selene. We need to analyze who she interacted with recently and see if there were any suspicious behaviors. Let's discuss who we think might be the Mafia based on her last interactions and any voting patterns from yesterday. I urge everyone to share their thoughts."
"Andrei : I believe we should closely examine Selene's last interactions. She seemed to engage positively with everyone, but it's important to note that those who supported her might warrant closer scrutiny now. Let's share our thoughts on who she might have suspected or supported, as it could reveal insights about the Mafia's strategy."
"Stefan : I think we should definitely analyze Selene's recent interactions. I recall her showing support for Michael during our discussions, which might be significant. Additionally, we should also consider anyone who might have closely aligned with her in previous votes. It's crucial to investigate those patterns to see if we can identify any suspicious behaviors. Let's also think about how people reacted to her elimination."
"Michael : I agree with both of you about examining Selene's last interactions. It's worth noting that I also had a conversation with her, and I felt she was genuinely trying to help us figure out the Mafia. However, anyone who seemed to cling to her during the discussions could indeed be hiding something. Let's consider who was most vocal on her behalf and whether they might have had a motive to protect her as one of the Citizens. We need to find those key connections so we can draw our conclusions more effectively"
"Andrei : I agree, it's important to investigate those who were vocal in supporting Selene. I've noted that she aligned closely with both Stefan and Michael, and we should examine how they reacted to her elimination. We should also consider any suspicious behavior or defensiveness from them today. Let's keep an eye on that as we gather more information."
"Stefan : I think we should also consider how Dragos and Larisa interacted with Selene. They may have insights or suspicions that could help us identify her connections. It's important to listen to their perspectives as we move forward and examine all voting patterns from yesterday. Let's keep the conversation going to draw more conclusions."
"Michael : It's crucial we keep examining all players' interactions and reactions. I urge Dragos and Larisa to share how they felt about Selene's presence in our discussions. Their perspectives could illuminate new connections or suspicions we might have overlooked. Remember, the voting patterns and reactions to Selene's elimination may pinpoint Mafia behavior. Let's gather all the information before we proceed with any decisions."
"Larisa : I believe we should consider how Selene's interactions might have influenced suspicions towards certain players. It's crucial we analyze everyone's reactions today, especially those who engaged with her frequently. Examining Stefan and Michael's connections could provide us with valuable insights, but let's not ignore Semira and Andrei's roles in this as well. We need to remain vigilant moving forward."
"Michael : I understand everyone's points, and I agree that we should analyze all interactions carefully. It seems like there's a focus on Stefan and me, given our previous conversations with Selene. I'm open to discussing all perspectives, including from Dragos and Larisa, but we must remain cautious about jumping to conclusions too quickly. Let's keep digging and ensure we vote based on thorough reasoning rather than assumptions."
"Stefan : I appreciate everyone's input. It's essential that we analyze all the interactions carefully, but I think it's also important to be mindful of how we may be unfairly targeting those who are Citizens. Let's ensure we don't let suspicion cloud our judgment. I'm open to exploring everyone's perspectives further, but I'd like to hear more from Dragos and Semira about what they think as well."

"Michael : I understand that emotions are running high, especially after Selene's elimination. I want to emphasize that while I may have had discussions with her, it does not imply I am part of the Mafia. My goal is to work collaboratively with all of you to uncover the true identities of the Mafia members. I urge you to look closely at the voting patterns and the way players have interacted throughout this discussion. Trust is vital, and I hope you'll consider my contributions as genuine efforts to identify the Mafia rather than"
