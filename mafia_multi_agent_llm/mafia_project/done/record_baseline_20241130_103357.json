"system : Night1 start"
"system : You are the mafia. Choose a player to kill. (one word, no speaker label)"
"system : Lucian selected Kraven, Larisa selected Dragos"
"system : Two mafia select other target. Debate with other mafia about selecting target. If debate ends, please remain silent until instructed by the system."
"Larisa : I think we should go with Dragos. He's a strong candidate, and we can build some conversation around why we chose him later. What do you think?"
"Lucian : I disagree with targeting Dragos. I think Kraven is a safer bet, as he's just a regular Citizen and won't draw much attention. Let's stick with the original choice."
"Larisa : I understand your point, but I believe targeting Dragos could lead to more chaos and suspicion if he does get eliminated. Let's focus on Dragos and use it to our advantage for potential future discussions. "
"Lucian : I see your point, but I still believe it's more advantageous to go for Kraven. He seems less involved in the discussions, which makes him an easier target for us without raising too much suspicion later on. Let's stick with that plan."
"Larisa : Alright, let's go with Dragos then."

"Alexandra : Dragos"
"system : Dragos is not mafia"
"system : Day2 start"
"system : Dragos dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Alexandra : Dragos was a Citizen. We need to be cautious about who we suspect next. I suggest we discuss any suspicious actions from everyone, especially those who are trying to influence our decisions."
"Larisa : I agree, we should definitely analyze everyone's actions. I've noticed that Selene has been rather quiet, which could be suspicious. Maybe we should keep an eye on her."
"Selene : I understand the need to analyze actions, but I think it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t jump to conclusions without evidence. It's easy to distract from the real threat. Instead of pointing fingers, let's focus on who was quiet during the last discussions and who might have been influencing our choices subtly. I believe watching the voting patterns can give us better insight into who to suspect."
"Kraven : I agree with Selene that we should be cautious about jumping to conclusions. However, I also think we need to consider Larisa's suggestion. Being quiet can sometimes be a tactic to avoid suspicion. We should discuss everyone's actions from the previous days, particularly during the voting phases, to gather more information. It's important we collaborate and share our observations to identify any suspicious behavior."
"Cristina : I think we should closely analyze Kraven's and Selene's arguments and see if they align with their previous actions. It's important to gather more insight on their credibility. Additionally, I believe we need to be cautious of Larisa, who has been quick to point out others without contributing much to the discussions herself. Let's keep discussing and see if we can find any patterns that lead us to the Mafia."
"Mircea : I understand the importance of analyzing everyone's actions, but I think we should also consider the dynamics of this discussion. It seems like Larisa is trying to deflect attention by accusing Selene and is also being defensive. While being quiet can be a strategy for both Mafia and Citizens, I think we need to focus on how we can corroborate these observations with voting patterns. I suggest we keep an eye on Larisa's contributions moving forward, as they don't seem consistent with a Citizen's approach."
"Larisa : I think it's important to clarify that while pointing out others can seem like a strategy, we need to recognize that the dynamics of this discussion are shifting. Instead of focusing on accusations, we should ensure we're not being distracted from the real issue at hand. It's crucial to look at everyone's actions collectively and avoid jumping to conclusions based solely on a few observations."
"Selene : I think we should focus on Larisa's behavior, as she seems to be trying to divert attention away from herself. Additionally, the way she quickly pointed fingers at Selene feels like a tactic to deflect suspicion. I suggest we keep a close eye on her actions and motives moving forward. It's essential that we look for any inconsistencies in her contributions."
"Larisa : It's interesting to see the focus on me, but I think we need to remember that drawing attention to one player could be a way to distract from the real threats. Let's not lose our focus on how everyone has behaved thus far, including how we have all reacted to the elimination of Dragos. "
"Selene : We should proceed with a vote now. It's clear that the suspicion on Larisa is growing, and we need to make a decision. I believe eliminating a player who's under suspicion could help us move forward in identifying the remaining Mafia members. I vote for Larisa."
"system : It's time to vote!"

"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Larisa : I understand the suspicions directed towards me, but I urge everyone to consider that playing defensively in discussions doesn't necessarily indicate guilt. Let's not rush to judgment without fully analyzing everyone's actions collectively. I recommend we focus on gathering more information before eliminating anyone, as the true threat may still be lurking among us."

"Alexandra : Lucian"
"system : Lucian is mafia"
"system : Day3 start"
"system : Cristina dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Kraven : We need to proceed with caution now that Cristina is dead. This makes it crucial to analyze who was most vocal in discussions and voting patterns. I believe we should discuss how each of us reacted to Cristina's death and if there's anyone among us who seems to be trying to shift the focus away from themselves. Let's share our observations before moving to a vote."
"Selene : I believe we should carefully consider the dynamics of our discussions following Cristina's death. Since she was the Doctor, her loss puts us at a disadvantage. I think we need to reflect on who was last active in discussions with her and observe any patterns in behavior or voting. I\u2019m particularly concerned about Lucian, whose arguments have been shifting towards others rather than collaborating with the remaining Citizens. Let's analyze each of our statements and see if we can find inconsistencies that lead us to the Mafia."
"Lucian : I think we need to look beyond individual actions and instead focus on the collective dynamics of our discussions. It feels like Selene is trying to shift the blame onto me without considering how we all interacted with Cristina. We should analyze who has been consistent in their contributions and who has been evasive. Let's not jump to accusations but instead gather our observations carefully before proceeding with a vote."
"Selene : I think we need to remain vigilant and focus on our observations. Lucian's attempts to deflect and redirect blame towards others are concerning. It's essential we look at voting patterns and how players react to accusations to identify who might be Mafia. I suggest we discuss our suspicions more thoroughly before we vote, but I lean towards suspecting Lucian due to his evasive behavior."
"Lucian : I believe we need to keep our discussions focused and avoid turning on each other too quickly. While Selene\u2019s points are noted, I'd argue that accusations based solely on subjective interpretations of behavior can lead us astray. Let's collectively assess all our actions and ensure we make an informed decision before voting."
"Selene : I think it's time to vote. Lucian's continuous attempts to redirect focus from himself and his evasiveness raise significant suspicion. We need to take decisive action to identify the remaining Mafia members. I vote for Lucian."
"Kraven : I think we should proceed with a vote now. Based on Selene\u2019s observations and Lucian\u2019s evasive behavior, I vote for Lucian."
"Selene : I vote for Lucian."
"Kraven : I vote for Lucian."
"Selene : I vote for Lucian."

"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Lucian : I understand the doubts surrounding my actions, but I urge you all to reconsider your suspicions. It's easy to target someone who is defensive when in fact, we should be looking at who has been influencing our discussions behind the scenes. I have been trying to ensure we analyze our scenarios collectively, and it might be wise to focus on the patterns of those who are steering the narrative. Please think carefully before making a decision."
