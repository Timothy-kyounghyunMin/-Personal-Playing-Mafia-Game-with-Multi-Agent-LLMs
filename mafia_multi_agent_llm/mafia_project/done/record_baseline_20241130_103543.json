"system : Day2 start"
"system : Mafia shot Selene, but doctor save Selene!"
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Selene : I\u2019m glad to be here this morning. Last night, the Mafia targeted me, but fortunately, the Doctor was able to save me. We need to remain vigilant and discuss how we can identify the Mafia. Let's share our thoughts and observations!"
"Marius : It's great to see you safe, Selene. The fact that you were targeted indicates you're likely a strong player. We should focus on discussing who might be acting suspiciously among us. I think we should analyze the behavior of those who seem more reserved or are avoiding the conversation. What do you all think?"
"Dracula : It's good to hear that you're safe, Selene. Marius makes a valid point about analyzing those who are being quiet. I think we should also keep an eye on anyone who seems overly defensive or tries to shift the focus away from themselves. It could be a sign of guilt. Let's share any observations we've made about each other in the discussions."
"Semira : It's reassuring to see you safe, Selene. I agree with the points made about observing those who are quieter or acting defensively. We should also consider the voting patterns from yesterday, as they might give us insight into who could be working with the Mafia. Let's pay attention to any suspicious behaviors and discuss them further."
"Andrei : I agree with the idea of analyzing voting patterns and suspicious behaviors. It's crucial that we scrutinize everyone\u2019s actions from the previous day. We should also consider the dynamics of the conversations happening now; sometimes, the way people respond can reveal their affiliations. I recommend we keep a close eye on Michael, especially given Selene's targeting. Let's discuss openly!"
"Michael : I agree with the points everyone has made, and it's vital we analyze the behavior of all players. I find it interesting that the focus seems to be shifting towards me. Let's not forget that assessing quiet behavior can also reveal hidden intentions. Let's keep an eye on those who are attempting to deflect attention away from themselves."
"Andrei : Michael, your defensiveness is raising my suspicions. I think we should consider the possibility that you might be affiliated with the Mafia. I suggest we focus our votes on you today, as Selene was targeted and saved, and you were the last person to receive attention. This could be a chance to uncover the truth. What does everyone think?"
"Marius : I understand the concerns, but shifting suspicion towards me feels like a strategy to divert attention from other players. Let's not rush to conclusions based on a single point of view. I suggest we discuss more evidence before making any decisions."
"Dragos : I think it's important to remain cautious with our accusations. While it's essential to look at everyone's behavior, we must ensure we have solid reasoning before voting someone out. Rushing to conclusions could lead to eliminating a valuable Citizen instead of a Mafia member. Let's consider the overall dynamics and ensure we discuss everyone\u2019s actions thoroughly before making a decision."
"Selene : I appreciate everyone's input and the caution being exercised. However, I believe we need to focus on those who have been evasive or defensive. While Michael is under scrutiny, I suggest we also examine Vladimir's involvement, as he has remained relatively quiet throughout our discussions. Let\u2019s ensure we look carefully at everyone\u2019s contributions before we reach a conclusion."
"system : It's time to vote!"
"system : Vote result is{'Andrei': [], 'Dracula': [], 'Selene': [], 'Semira': [], 'Marius': [], 'Michael': ['Andrei', 'Dracula', 'Selene', 'Semira', 'Marius', 'Dragos', 'Vladimir'], 'Dragos': [], 'Vladimir': ['Michael']}"
"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Michael : I understand the concerns raised about my behavior, but I assure you I am a Citizen just like the rest of you. Targeting me based on suspicion alone is risky and could lead to the elimination of an innocent player. I urge you all to reconsider your accusations and look closely at those who have been manipulating the conversation or deflecting suspicion towards others. Let's work together to find the actual Mafia members!"
"system : It's time for final vote!"
"system : Final result is {'y': ['Andrei', 'Dracula', 'Selene', 'Semira', 'Marius', 'Dragos'], 'n': ['Vladimir']}.\nMichael executed!Michael was mafia!"

"system : Vladimir is not mafia"
"system : Day3 start"
"system : Vladimir dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Dragos : It's unfortunate to see Vladimir eliminated. We managed to eliminate one Mafia member last night, which is a step in the right direction, but we need to stay vigilant. \n\nWe should discuss the remaining players and their behaviors closely. I believe the focus should be on those who have been quieter or haven't contributed much to the discussions. We need to ensure we collaborate effectively to identify any remaining Mafia members. Let's share our observations so we can make informed decisions!"
"Selene : It's unfortunate that Vladimir was eliminated. We need to analyze the behaviors of those who are left and pay close attention to any inconsistencies. I believe we should focus on Semira, as she has been relatively quiet and we need to ensure that all players are contributing to the discussions. Let's make sure we discuss everyone openly and share our observations."
"Semira : I understand the concerns about my contributions, but I assure you I'm actively working to identify the Mafia members like the rest of you. It's essential that we look at everyone's behaviors, including those who might be trying to deflect attention away from themselves. I suggest we take a closer look at Dragos, as he seems to be directing suspicion towards others while remaining somewhat reserved. Let's ensure we evaluate all players fairly before making any final decisions."
"Andrei : I understand the concerns about Semira's contributions, but I believe it's crucial to remain cautious about making accusations without sufficient evidence. We must also consider each player's overall behavior and the dynamics that have unfolded. I suggest we take a closer look at Dragos as well, especially since he has been directing suspicion toward others. Let's ensure we have a thorough discussion before we decide on our next steps."
"Selene : I appreciate the discussions, but I believe we need to stay focused on those who have been deflecting attention while not contributing much. Dragos has been directing suspicion towards others without much evidence. It's crucial that we make our decisions based on clear observations and not just on accusations. Let's keep discussing and share any further insights before we reach a conclusion."
"Semira : I believe we should take a closer look at both Dragos and Marius, as they have been directing suspicion without substantial evidence. Let's continue discussing everyone's contributions and ensure we reach a fair conclusion based on careful observations."
"Marius : I think we need to be careful with our accusations. Dragos has been quite vocal about directing suspicion towards others, which could be a tactic to deflect attention from himself. Let's not forget that sometimes the most outspoken players can be hiding their true intentions. It\u2019s essential to evaluate everyone\u2019s actions critically before making a decision."
"Selene : I think we need to act with caution. While Dragos has been vocal, let's remember that Marius has also been involved in shifting suspicions without providing evidence. I believe it\u2019s important to discuss both of their behaviors rather than solely focusing on one person. Let's keep assessing everyone\u2019s actions and reach a consensus before voting."
"Marius : I believe it's crucial to assess both Dragos and Semira\u2019s actions carefully. While there are valid concerns about their contributions, it's essential we don't rush into voting without solid reasoning. Let's delve into their past behaviors and interactions before deciding our next steps."
"Selene : I believe we should focus our attention on Marius and Dragos together since both have been deflecting suspicion toward each other without providing concrete evidence. It's crucial we evaluate their actions and how they interact with the group before making a decision. Let\u2019s discuss their behaviors further to determine our next steps effectively."
