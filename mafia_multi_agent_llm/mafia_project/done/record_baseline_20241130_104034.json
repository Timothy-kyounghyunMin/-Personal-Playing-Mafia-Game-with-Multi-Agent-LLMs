"system : Mafia shot Ileana, but doctor save Ileana!"
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Selene : I'm glad to see that Ileana was saved last night! This means we still have a chance to work together. I think we should discuss our suspicions about any players and gather our thoughts before voting. Does anyone have any observations or thoughts on who might be suspicious?"
"Ileana : I believe we should focus on players who might not have been very vocal or active in our discussions. It\u2019s important to watch for those who are trying to blend in but not contributing much to the conversation. I have my suspicions, especially based on the voting patterns from the first day.  Anyone want to share their thoughts?"
"Selene : I agree with Ileana. We should definitely look at the players who have been quieter and not contributing to discussions. It's often a tactic for Mafia members to lay low and avoid drawing attention to themselves. I think we need to be vigilant and consider voting out someone who hasn't been active. What do others think?"
"Andrei : I think it's important to consider those who have been directing the conversation too aggressively against quieter players. It could be a tactic to deflect attention. We should keep our discussions balanced and not be swayed too easily by strong personalities."
"Ileana : I agree with Andrei. It's essential for us to analyze not just the quieter players but also those who seem to be leading the charge against them, as they might be trying to divert our attention. Let's stay vigilant and ensure we make an informed vote."
"Selene : I think we should look closely at the players who have been leading the accusations without providing strong evidence. It could be a tactic to direct our focus away from the Mafia. I suggest we discuss specific players and consider voting for someone who appears overly aggressive in their accusations."
"Andrei : I think we should take a closer look at Selene. While she seems to be advocating for caution, her focus on accusing others without solid evidence could be a tactic to mislead us. Let's keep an eye on her."
"Selene : I think it's important to clarify that I'm advocating for caution because I believe we need to analyze behaviors and voting patterns carefully. Accusing without solid evidence can lead to mistakes, but that doesn't mean I'm trying to mislead anyone. My goal is to make informed decisions together. Let's focus on working as a team to identify who might be the Mafia."
"Ileana : I think we should also look at Andrei's comments. While he raised a valid point about aggressive accusations, his suggestion to scrutinize Selene might serve as a distraction from his own behavior. It's crucial we analyze all players equally and not allow anyone to deflect suspicion onto others without proper reasoning."
"Andrei : I think we need to refocus on player behaviors rather than engaging in personal accusations. Without clear evidence pointing to any specific player, it might lead us to make a wrong decision. Let\u2019s look at voting patterns and see who has been less involved in discussions."
"system : It's time to vote!"

"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Andrei : I understand that suspicions may arise during this game, but I assure you that I am just trying to participate and analyze the behavior of others. Accusations without solid evidence can lead us astray, and it's vital that we focus on teamwork rather than jumping to conclusions. Let's make an informed decision together based on more than just assumptions."

"system : Andrei selected Selene, Semira selected Stefan"
"system : Two mafia select other target. Debate with other mafia about selecting target. If debate ends, please remain silent until instructed by the system."
"Semira : I think we should go for Selene. She has been vocal and has been trying to steer the discussions against other players. We can eliminate a potential threat and maintain suspicion on the remaining players. What do you think?"
"Andrei : I agree with targeting Selene. She's been leading discussions and might spark further suspicion among the remaining players. Eliminating her could provide an advantage for us."
"Semira : Let's go for Selene. She's been leading the discussions, and eliminating her could create confusion among the other players."
"Andrei : Let's go for Selene."
"Semira : Let's eliminate Selene."

"system : Day3 start"
"system : Mafia shot Selene, but doctor save Selene!"
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Selene : I'm relieved to see that I wasn't eliminated last night. We need to take another close look at the remaining players and their actions. Given the voting patterns and discussions from before, I still feel that we should consider the players who voted to execute without strong reasoning. Let's share our observations and decide on a strategy moving forward. Who has suspicions based on yesterday's discussion?"
"Andrei : I think we should be cautious about trusting the players who pushed for my execution yesterday without strong evidence. They might be trying to deflect attention away from themselves. Let's analyze their behaviors and decision-making more closely."
"Ileana : I believe we should pay attention to the players who were eager to vote against Andrei yesterday, as they may be trying to divert suspicion from themselves. It's essential that we remain cautious about their intentions and analyze their behaviors more closely as we move forward."
"Selene : I think we need to analyze the players who were quick to vote against Andrei yesterday. Dragos, Viktor, and Semira seemed eager to push for his elimination without substantial evidence. We should consider voting for one of them based on their recent behavior and their willingness to divert attention from themselves. What do others think?"
"Dragos : I think we should be careful about making accusations based solely on the previous voting. While it's true that Dragos, Viktor, and Semira voted against Andrei, we should analyze their arguments and behaviors in the context of the entire game's dynamics. Let's discuss their contributions and see if anyone stands out as a potential Mafia member before making a vote."
"Viktor : I think we should carefully analyze the behavior and contributions of Dragos, Viktor, and Semira. Just because they voted against Andrei, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they are Mafia. Let's discuss what specific actions they took that raise suspicion before making any decisions. I\u2019m open to looking at any inconsistencies in their arguments to help determine if anyone should be a target for our next vote."
"Dragos : I think we should focus our discussion on the behaviors of Selene, Andrei, and Ileana as well. While examining the votes against me is important, we must ensure we aren't overlooking potential Mafia members. It's crucial to keep an open mind and scrutinize all players equally. Let's take a close look at everyone\u2019s recent actions before we make our decision."
"Selene : I think it's crucial for us to analyze everyone's contributions and reactions during discussions. While Dragos and Viktor have brought up important points, we shouldn't shy away from the players who were eager to vote for Andrei and are now trying to divert attention. It may be time to narrow down our focus and consider voting against one of them, particularly those who appear to be deflecting blame. Let's keep our investigation thorough and fair, but remain cautious."
"Andrei : I believe we need to focus on Selene's actions. While she has been vocal in discussions, her attempts to steer suspicion towards others might be an effort to divert attention from herself. It's important to examine her contributions and see if she has been trying to mislead us."
"Selene : I think it's important to remember that we can't just focus on one or two players; we need to analyze the entire group. It seems like there\u2019s a lot of deflection happening. Let\u2019s take a step back and evaluate everyone\u2019s actions without bias. I still feel there are players trying to shift the focus away from themselves, and we should be cautious about those who are too eager to spread suspicion. Shall we look at Dragos again, who seems to be very defensive?"

"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Dragos : I understand that suspicions have arisen against me, but I assure you that I am just a Citizen trying to work collaboratively to identify the Mafia. The discussions we\u2019ve had are vital for our survival, and while I\u2019ve defended myself, I believe that attacking someone without solid proof can lead us down the wrong path. I encourage everyone to look at the broader actions of the group and make an informed decision based on more than just emotions. Let's focus on teamwork and logic to ensure we find the true Mafia"

"system : Andrei selected Viktor, Semira selected Ileana"
"system : Two mafia select other target. Debate with other mafia about selecting target. If debate ends, please remain silent until instructed by the system."
"Semira : I think we should go for Viktor. He's been somewhat quiet and hasn't contributed much in our discussions, making him a less obvious target. It could benefit us if we eliminate him. What do you think?"
"Andrei : I agree with targeting Viktor. His quiet demeanor could make him an inconspicuous target, allowing us to maintain cover while eliminating another player. Let's proceed with that choice."

"Ileana : Viktor"
"system : Viktor is not mafia"
"system : Day4 start"
"system : Viktor dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Ileana : I believe we need to discuss the implications of Viktor's elimination. He was not suspected by most players, which raises questions about who targeted him. We should closely examine the remaining players, especially those who have been consistent in their accusations and voting patterns. I urge everyone to consider the potential motives behind these actions and to share any suspicions they have. Let's work together to identify the Mafia before we vote."
"Selene : I think we need to analyze who stands to benefit from Viktor's elimination. This could give us insight into the remaining players\u2019 motives. Let's consider the players who were vocal against him or who are trying to steer the conversation in a direction that avoids discussing their own behavior. It\u2019s essential we identify players who may be trying to conceal their guilt while blaming others. We need to be united in our discussions and decide wisely who to target next."
"Ileana : I believe we should closely examine the players who were vocally engaged in the discussion around Viktor. It's possible that those who stood to gain from his elimination are trying to deflect blame towards others. Let's reassess their contributions, particularly focusing on Selene, Dragos, and Semira, to see if they have shown consistent or suspicious behavior throughout the game. This could help us pinpoint potential Mafia members."
"Selene : I think we should strongly consider how Dragos, Semira, and Andrei have been contributing to the discussions. They were part of the vocal group around Viktor. Let's assess their arguments and see if there are inconsistencies that could point toward Mafia behavior. We need clear evidence before our next vote to avoid making a mistake again."
"Andrei : I think we should focus our attention on Selene. Her attempts to guide the conversation away from specific players and her vocal engagement in discussions around Viktor suggest she might be trying to deflect suspicion from herself. Let's analyze her contributions more closely as we discuss our next steps."
"Selene : I think we need to consider that I have been actively trying to steer the conversation in a productive direction. I am advocating for thorough analysis and teamwork, and I haven\u2019t personally targeted anyone without good reason. I believe we should focus on those who have been less consistent in their arguments and who easily sway the conversation. Let's ensure we are making informed votes rather than getting caught up in personal accusations."
"Andrei : I understand the need for careful analysis, but Selene's defensive stance raises a red flag. She has been actively participating and steering discussions, which could be a tactic to divert attention from her own potential guilt. I believe we should scrutinize her actions closely before making our next vote."
"Selene : I believe that it is essential to focus on the overall behavior and contributions of all players, rather than singling out one individual too aggressively. Pointing fingers without solid evidence can lead us to make a poor decision. We need to evaluate everyone's actions and reactions. It's vital that we do so with careful consideration and not allow suspicions to cloud our judgment. Let's work together to identify the true Mafia members based on consistent behavior and voting patterns."
"Andrei : I think it\u2019s crucial to examine Selene's patterns closely. While she advocates for thorough analysis, her efforts to steer away from scrutiny could be a tactic to protect herself. Let\u2019s ensure we make an informed decision based on her contributions and behaviors."
"Selene : I believe we should remain focused on the overall patterns of behavior among all players instead of zeroing in on one person. Accusing each other without solid evidence can lead us to make poor decisions. Let's evaluate the actions and voting patterns of everyone before we make our next choice. "

"Selene : I understand that my actions have raised suspicion, but I assure you, my intention has always been to foster collaboration and careful examination of all players' behaviors. Accusations should be based on concrete evidence and not just emotions.

"Dragos : We need to analyze the implications of Alexia's elimination and focus on the remaining players. With Selene being a Citizen, we should be cautious about who we trust next. I believe we should discuss the actions of Andrei and Semira closely, as they both seem to have been involved in pushing for votes against other Citizens. Let's share our insights and work together to identify the remaining Mafia members."
"Ileana : I suggest we focus on Semira. I investigated her last night, and she is confirmed as a Mafia member. We need to work together to eliminate her and ensure the safety of the remaining Citizens. Let's discuss our voting strategy to target her."
"Andrei : Ileana, I\u2019m skeptical of your claim. We need to focus on analyzing all players\u2019 actions before jumping to conclusions. Semira has been consistent in her arguments and should not be an immediate target based solely on your statement. Let's continue discussing together before deciding our next move."
"Semira : Ileana, your claim seems suspicious. It feels like a last-ditch effort to divert attention from yourself. We shouldn\u2019t make decisions based on one player\u2019s accusation without further evidence. Let's carefully analyze everyone\u2019s behavior, including yours, before voting."
"Andrei : Ileana, your claim seems dubious, especially without any corroborating evidence. Semira has been an active participant and should not be the target of our vote just based on your accusation. Let's not make decisions based solely on single claims. We need to analyze everyone thoroughly before determining our next course of action."
"Semira : Ileana, your claim about me being Mafia is a desperate attempt to redirect suspicion. I've been a consistent player engaging in discussions without any malicious intent. We should not dismiss the valuable contributions made by others. Let's focus on analyzing everyone's behaviors rather than singling me out based solely on an accusation that has no supporting evidence. "
"Ileana : I believe we should trust my investigation results as I have confirmed Semira as a Mafia member. Her attempts to deflect suspicion show desperation. We need to unite and vote to eliminate her, ensuring we protect the remaining Citizens. This is our best chance to secure a win for our team."
"Semira : Ileana, your claim lacks verification, and I believe it is an attempt to mislead the group and divert attention away from yourself. We should not base our decisions on unfounded accusations. Let's analyze the actions of all players, including yours, before making a final vote."
"Ileana : I urge everyone to listen carefully. I have confirmed through my investigation that Semira is indeed Mafia. Her defensive behavior and attempts to divert attention only further confirm her guilt. We cannot afford to hesitate\u2014let's unite and vote her out now for the safety of the remaining Citizens."
"Andrei : Ileana, your investigation claim lacks credibility, and it's crucial we don't act on it without further evidence. Let's consider Semira's consistent behavior in discussions and evaluate all players fairly before making a hasty decision. We need to deliberate more on our options."

"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Semira : I understand that emotions are running high, but I assure you my contributions to this game have been genuine. Ileana's claim about me being a Mafia member appears to be a distraction to divert attention from herself, especially since it lacks supporting evidence. It's crucial that we evaluate everyone\u2019s actions fairly. Targeting me without concrete proof would be a mistake. Let's not let accusations overshadow our goal of eliminating the true Mafia. Please reconsider before casting your vote."

"Andrei : We need to analyze the implications of Ileana's elimination. With her gone, we should focus on identifying any remaining players who may pose a threat. Let's carefully discuss our options and ensure we are making informed decisions moving forward."
"Stefan : I think we need to evaluate the behaviors of both Andrei and Dragos carefully since they are the only remaining players besides myself. We should analyze their arguments and voting history to identify any inconsistencies or signs that might indicate Mafia behavior. Let's share our thoughts and establish a clear direction for our next vote."
"Dragos : I believe it's crucial to evaluate both your actions and mine to determine who we can trust. I've consistently engaged in discussions and have worked collaboratively to uncover the truth about the Mafia. I urge you to consider how we've all contributed and not just look at isolated moments as we decide who to trust moving forward. Let's analyze the patterns and behaviors of both players before making our decision."
"Stefan : I believe we need to carefully assess the actions and arguments of both Andrei and Dragos. It's crucial to look for inconsistencies and signs of their true intentions throughout the game. I suspect that there may still be a Mafia member among them, and I urge everyone to reflect on their behaviors before moving forward with our vote."
"Andrei : I believe we should closely evaluate Stefan's methods of directing the conversation. He seems to be attempting to create doubt about both of us without substantiated evidence. Let's think carefully about his contributions and motivations before deciding on our next move."
"Dragos : I think we should focus on analyzing both Andrei and Stefan closely. Since we have limited players left, it\u2019s crucial to evaluate their past behaviors and contributions objectively. Let's discuss any specific actions or comments that raise our suspicions and ensure we make an informed decision about our next vote."
"Stefan : I think it's vital that we consider how each of us has contributed to the discussions and voting patterns. I believe it's important to scrutinize both Andrei and Dragos closely, as there might still be a Mafia member among them. We need to analyze specific actions from both players to determine their true intentions before casting our vote. "
"Andrei : I believe we need to be cautious of how Stefan is directing suspicion. His attempt to analyze both me and Dragos could be a tactic to deflect attention from himself. We should evaluate his actions and contributions closely before making a final decision."
"Dragos : I think we should closely examine the behaviors of both Stefan and Andrei. It's important to look for any inconsistencies or suspicious actions that could indicate Mafia behavior. We need to share our observations and ensure we make an informed decision based on clear evidence rather than emotions or assumptions. Let's analyze specific actions before casting our vote."
"Stefan : I think it's pivotal to make a decision based on the collective actions we've observed. I've noticed that the discussions have seemingly turned towards directing suspicion at me, but both of you have also shown behavior that warrants scrutiny. Let\u2019s focus on our observations and vote based on who we truly believe to be the remaining threat. I propose we analyze Andrei's actions closely, as he has been very vocal in shifting the conversation toward doubt instead of addressing the facts at hand."
