"Emil : I'm Emil, and I'm looking forward to working with everyone to figure out who the Mafia is. Let's make this an interesting game!"

"system : Selene selected Andrei, Dragos selected Cristina"
"system : Two mafia select other target. Debate with other mafia about selecting target. If debate ends, please remain silent until instructed by the system."
"Dragos : I think we should stick with eliminating Cristina since she was the target I selected initially. Andrei might have given us more trouble later on. What do you think?"
"Selene : I understand your concern, but eliminating Andrei might be less risky in the long run. He could be trying to collaborate and share information, which could help the Citizens. Cristina doesn't seem to pose an immediate threat. What if we go for Andrei this time?"
"Dragos : I see your point, but I still believe it's easier to eliminate Cristina right now. She could be someone who's more focused on gathering information among the players. What if we go with my initial target then?"
"Selene : Let's go with Cristina then. It might be the safer option for this round."

"Emil : Vladimir"
"system : Vladimir is not mafia"
"system : Day2 start"
"system : Cristina dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Emil : It\u2019s unfortunate that Cristina has been eliminated. We should discuss who might be involved with the Mafia and share any suspicions or observations. I think we need to carefully examine everyone\u2019s behavior and voting patterns from the previous day to identify potential Mafia members. Who has any thoughts on who might be acting suspiciously?"
"Dragos : I think we should look at how everyone reacted to Cristina's elimination. It's often the quieter players who might be hiding something. What do you all think about Andrei? He seemed pretty focused on collaborating yesterday."
"Emil : I understand your concern, Dragos, but I wouldn't jump to conclusions about Andrei just yet. It's essential to consider everyone's behavior and contributions to the discussion. We should closely analyze how everyone has been participating and communicating since Cristina's elimination. I personally found nothing suspicious about Andrei's collaboration, but I'm open to hearing more opinions. "
"Andrei : I think it's important to remain cautious and ensure we discuss everyone's behavior. While Dragos pointed out my focus on collaboration, I believe it's crucial we do not target individuals without strong evidence. Let's hear from others as well; they may have insights on suspicious behaviors or voting patterns we should consider."
"Vladimir : I think it\u2019s vital we examine everyone's actions and statements closely. Dragos raising suspicion about Andrei could be a diversion tactic. We need to ensure that we're not undermining a potential ally. Let's keep the conversation open and perhaps consider how Selene and Michael reacted to Cristina's death. Have they shown any unusual behavior that raises flags?"
"Michael : I appreciate the insights from everyone. I think it's crucial for us to stay critical of each other's actions. I haven't noticed anything particularly unusual with Selene or my own reactions, but I agree we should look out for any changes in behavior moving forward. It would help us identify the Mafia's strategies more effectively. Let's keep discussing and sharing our observations."
"Selene : I believe it\u2019s important to remain open-minded about everyone's actions. While Dragos has raised suspicions about Andrei, we shouldn't overlook the potential for this to be a strategy to shift our focus away from him. Maybe we should consider how Dragos has been directing the conversation. It's essential that we all share our thoughts."
"Emil : I think we should carefully evaluate Dragos's role in this discussion. While he brought up Andrei's focus on collaboration, his attempts to redirect suspicion away from himself could also indicate he's trying to protect a Mafia member. Let\u2019s keep a close watch on him, as well as the reactions from others as the discussion continues."
"Kraven : I think it's essential to keep our focus on Dragos as he has been quite vocal in directing the conversation. While collaboration is important, his attempts to shift suspicion onto Andrei could suggest he is trying to protect himself or another Mafia member. Let's continue to scrutinize his reactions and contributions to see if they align with a Citizen's intentions. "
"Andrei : I agree that we should keep a close eye on Dragos, especially since he has been very vocal about directing our focus toward Andrei. It's important for us to remember that anyone can manipulate the conversation, regardless of their actual alignment. We need to make sure we\u2019re examining everyone's statements and actions thoroughly. It might also be worthwhile to revisit our suspicions about others soon, particularly those who haven't spoken much yet."

"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Dragos : I understand the concerns raised, but I assure you that my intentions are to work collaboratively with everyone else. Accusations can easily shift focus away from those who might truly be the Mafia. Let\u2019s not rush to judgment without clear evidence. I encourage everyone to consider the broader actions and discussions of all players before making any decisions."

"Emil : Kraven"
"system : Kraven is not mafia"
"system : Day3 start"
"system : Michael dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Emil : It's unfortunate that Michael has been eliminated. With Dragos confirmed as Mafia, we must focus on the remaining players. I investigated Kraven during the night and found he is not Mafia, which means we're left with Selene, Vladimir, and Andrei. I suggest we discuss their actions and any observations we have about them, especially considering how they reacted to the previous votes and events."
"Vladimir : It's disappointing to lose another player. I trust Emil's investigation, which clears Kraven. This leaves us with Selene and Andrei to scrutinize. We should focus on their actions and voting patterns, especially in light of Michael\u2019s death. Let's discuss their contributions and see if any suspicions arise from their statements or behavior."
"Selene : While I understand the focus on Andrei and me, it\u2019s essential to remember that Emil's investigation results point to Kraven being clear of suspicion. The way the conversations have shifted around Andrei and me could be an attempt to divert attention away from Emil, who seems to be leading the discussion. Let's analyze how Emil has presented information and whether there's any inconsistency in his claims. It's vital to approach this with a critical eye."
"Andrei : I appreciate Selene's point about redirecting suspicion. However, we should critically examine Emil\u2019s investigation results and how he is guiding the discussion. We can\u2019t overlook the fact that if he is indeed a Citizen, he\u2019s working towards our goal of eliminating the Mafia. At the same time, we need to dig deeper into Selene's past reactions and contributions. I think it's crucial for us to analyze all players\u2019 actions without bias."
"Selene : While it's important to evaluate all players, I believe we need to be careful about how we are perceiving Emil's involvement. His investigation could easily be a way to gain our trust while manipulating the narrative. We should scrutinize how he presents his findings and whether his storyline remains consistent. Let's not overlook the possibility that he could be attempting to deflect suspicion away from himself."
"Andrei : I understand the concerns about Emil\u2019s investigation, but we should not forget the importance of evaluating actions collectively. We need to ensure that any suspicions are rooted in observed behavior rather than just conjecture. Let\u2019s examine all players closely and determine who truly poses a threat. It\u2019s vital for us to avoid misjudging a Citizen based on speculation."
"Selene : I agree that we should look closely at everyone's actions, but let's not forget the importance of staying vigilant against Emil's potentially manipulative tactics. His investigation results may appear credible, but they could also be a strategic move to foster trust and divert suspicion. We need to analyze how he is engaging with us and whether there are any inconsistencies that could hint at him being part of the Mafia."
"Andrei : I think we should focus on the voting patterns and how everyone has engaged in discussions. While Selene has raised valid concerns about Emil, I believe it\u2019s crucial that we evaluate everyone based on their actions. We need to work together to identify inconsistencies and ensure we are not misjudging each other. We must scrutinize Selene and Emil equally moving forward."
"Selene : I agree, we should evaluate voting patterns closely. However, I feel it\u2019s vital to focus more intensively on Emil's behavior and how it might be guiding our decisions. If we analyze his contributions thoroughly, we might uncover inconsistencies that can reveal his true alignment. It's critical that we do not simply go along with his narrative without questioning it."
"Emil : I understand the concerns raised about my role, but I've consistently pushed for discussions based on evidence and insights. I've investigated both Vladimir and Kraven, who are clear of being Mafia, which narrows down our options. While it's important to scrutinize everyone's actions equally, I maintain that the focus on trying to undermine my investigation is a tactic to create doubt. I urge everyone to concentrate on assessing Selene and Andrei based on their behaviors moving forward, as they are the only two remaining who could potentially"

"Selene : I understand that I have become a target, but I urge everyone to consider the patterns of behavior in this game. Emil's investigation results lead him to be seen as trustworthy, but it is crucial to remember that he controls the narrative. We should not overlook the fact that this is a game of deception; it is easy for anyone, including him, to manipulate our thoughts. Let's focus on ensuring we make a decision that doesn't lead to eliminating another Citizen without strong evidence."
