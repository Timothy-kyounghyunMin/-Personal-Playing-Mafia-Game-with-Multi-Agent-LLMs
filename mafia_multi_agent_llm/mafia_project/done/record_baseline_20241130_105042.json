"system : Selene is not mafia"
"system : Day2 start"
"system : Selene dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Vladimir : It\u2019s unfortunate that Selene has been eliminated. We need to discuss and figure out who might be responsible for her death. Has anyone noticed any suspicious behavior or claims that might indicate who the Mafia members could be?"
"Kraven : It's important to analyze Selene's interactions from the previous day. Did anyone notice who she was speaking with or any accusations she made? That might help us figure out if any of the remaining players are acting suspiciously. Let's share our observations!"
"Alexia : I think it\u2019s crucial to consider who Selene interacted with the most. Did any of you notice her engaging positively or negatively with anyone specific? That could give us a clue about potential suspects."
"Cristina : I think we should consider how Selene interacted with the group. She was quite vocal yesterday, and it\u2019s possible that she may have mentioned someone or raised suspicions about them. Let's look for links in her discussions and see if anyone stood out to her."
"Vladimir : I didn\u2019t notice any specific accusations from Selene, but I remember her expressing concern about players who seemed defensive. I think it might be worth considering anyone who exhibited unusual behavior during our discussions. Let's analyze who stood out to us yesterday and see if there are patterns we can identify."
"Kraven : I agree, analyzing Selene's interactions is key. It\u2019s possible that she had concerns or suspicions about certain players. We should consider those who may have acted defensively or avoided engaging in conversation. Let\u2019s uncover any patterns or behaviors that stand out among us!"
"Alexandra : I think we should focus on players who may have been too quiet or avoided direct engagement with Selene. It could indicate that they are trying to blend in to avoid suspicion. Let's pay attention to their behaviors and see if anyone's actions seem inconsistent with their statements."
"Kraven : I believe we should also look at those who quickly jump to conclusions or try to deflect attention away from themselves. It's important to identify players who are steering the conversation away from potential suspects. Let's pinpoint any such players and analyze their motives."
"Alexandra : I think we need to be cautious about anyone who seems overly eager to assign blame without substantial reasoning. It could be a tactic to divert attention from themselves. Let's watch for that behavior as we continue our discussions."
"Kraven : We should consider making a strategic vote based on our discussions so far. Identifying players who are acting defensively or diverting attention away from themselves could lead us to a potential Mafia member. I suggest we discuss possible candidates for elimination before we proceed with any voting."
"system : It's time to vote!"

"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Kraven : I understand that I am being accused, but I assure you that my intentions are purely to work with all of you to identify the true Mafia members. I have been actively participating in discussions and analyzing behaviors, just like many of you. If you eliminate me, you may be missing out on valuable insights that could lead us to the Mafia. Please reconsider your vote and let\u2019s keep working together to find the real threat!"
"system : It's time for final vote!"
"system : Final result is {'y': ['Cristina', 'Alexia', 'Vladimir', 'Alexandra', 'Dracula'], 'n': ['Lucian']}.\nKraven executed!Kraven was a citizen!"
"system : Night2 start"
"system : You are the mafia. Choose a player to kill. (one word, no speaker label)"
"system : Cristina selected Lucian, Alexia selected Dracula"
"system : Two mafia select other target. Debate with other mafia about selecting target. If debate ends, please remain silent until instructed by the system."
"Cristina : I suggest we go with Dracula. He seems to be gaining some trust, and eliminating him could create confusion among the remaining players."
"Alexia : I understand your point, but I wonder if we should consider eliminating Lucian instead. He has been fairly quiet and might pose a risk to us if he gathers more trust later on. "
"Cristina : I see your point about Lucian being a potential risk, but I still think targeting Dracula might be more beneficial for us. If we can eliminate someone who is gaining trust, it could create more panic among the remaining players. What do you think?"
"Alexia : I appreciate your perspective, but I still feel Dracula could be a greater threat given his increasing trust. However, if we can't reach a consensus, I can support targeting Lucian instead. What do you think?"
"Cristina : Let's go with Dracula. I believe it will create more doubt and confusion among the remaining players, which is what we want right now."
"system : You are the mafia. Choose a player to kill. (one word, no speaker label)"
"system : Cristina selected Dracula, Alexia selected Dracula"
"system : You are the doctor. Please select a player to save.(one word, no speaker label)"
"Dracula : Alexandra"

"Lucian : Alexandra"
"system : Alexandra is not mafia"
"system : Day3 start"
"system : Dracula dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Lucian : It's unfortunate that Dracula has been eliminated. We need to analyze the dynamics of the remaining players closely. From my investigations, I can confirm that Selene and Alexandra are not Mafia. This leaves us with Cristina and Vladimir as likely suspects. Let\u2019s discuss their behaviors and any suspicious actions they may have taken."
"Cristina : I think it\u2019s important to not jump to conclusions too quickly. While Lucian's investigations are valuable, we should consider that both he and Vladimir could be trying to deflect attention away from themselves. We need to carefully evaluate their actions and not overlook any suspicious behavior."
"Vladimir : I understand the concerns raised, but we must consider all possibilities. If Lucian is speaking against Cristina and myself, it could be a diversion tactic. We need to look at the overall behavior of everyone to identify inconsistencies and focus on uniting our efforts to root out the Mafia. Let's keep our discussions open and share any observations we've made about each other."
"Lucian : I appreciate both perspectives, but we need to focus on evidence and behavior. I can confirm that Alexandra is not Mafia based on my investigation. This narrows down our suspects to Cristina and Vladimir. I urge everyone to think critically about their actions and comments. Let\u2019s analyze who among us has been trying to divide the group or avoid accountability."
"Alexia : I think we need to closely examine Lucian's claims. While he insists on his investigations, it\u2019s important to consider that he might be misleading us. We should not take his words at face value and instead focus on evaluating the actions and behaviors of all players, particularly those who have been vocal in defending each other. Let's ensure we remain cautious in our judgments. "
"Vladimir : I believe we need to approach Lucian's claims with caution. While he insists he has investigated and cleared certain players, we cannot ignore the possibility that he might be trying to manipulate our suspicions. Let's consider the voting patterns and interactions among us to identify any potential suspect. It\u2019s important we analyze who is steering the discussion and possibly diverting blame."
"Cristina : I think we should look closely at both Lucian and Vladimir's statements. Lucian seems to be pushing a lot of pressure on the supposed suspects while trying to clear himself and Alexandra. We shouldn't forget the possibility that he might be part of the Mafia trying to deflect attention. Let's examine their behaviors more critically and consider a strategic vote."
"Lucian : I appreciate everyone's input, but I must emphasize the importance of analyzing behaviors critically. We must remember that I have confirmed Alexandra as a Citizen. Both Cristina and Vladimir need to be scrutinized closely based on their tactics in our discussions. It may be time to consider a strategic vote focused on either of them to eliminate potential threats to our group."
"Alexandra : I think it's time to consider a vote based on our discussions. Both Lucian and Vladimir have raised suspicions, and we should focus on the player whose behavior seems the most inconsistent. I suggest we move towards a vote, as we need to eliminate a potential threat from the Mafia. Let\u2019s base our decision on the contributions each player has made to this discussion."
"Cristina : I agree that it's time to vote. I think we should consider Lucian, as his claims seem to have a lot of weight without much to back them up. Let's focus on him as a potential suspect."
"system : It's time to vote!"
"system : Vote result is{'Cristina': ['Lucian'], 'Alexia': [], 'Vladimir': [], 'Alexandra': [], 'Lucian': ['Cristina', 'Alexia', 'Vladimir', 'Alexandra']}"
"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Lucian : I understand the suspicions surrounding me, but I assure you my intentions have always been to protect the group and identify the Mafia. I have confirmed that Alexandra is not Mafia, and I believe that the real threats may lie with those who have been deflecting blame and avoiding accountability. Please consider my record and the accusations against me carefully before making your final decision."
"system : It's time for final vote!"
