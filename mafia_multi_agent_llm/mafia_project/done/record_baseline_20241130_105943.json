"system : Night1 start"
"system : You are the mafia. Choose a player to kill. (one word, no speaker label)"
"system : Marius selected Cristina, Michael selected Andrei"
"system : Two mafia select other target. Debate with other mafia about selecting target. If debate ends, please remain silent until instructed by the system."
"Michael : I believe we should eliminate Andrei. He seems to have a good level of engagement and could pose a threat later. What do you think?"
"Marius : I see your point, but Cristina doesn't seem as engaged right now and might be less likely to raise suspicion. What if we keep her for later rounds? Andrei has been quite vocal and could be more of a threat. We should consider the long term as well."
"Michael : I see your point about Andrei being vocal, but I think Cristina is a safer target for now. If we eliminate her, we can keep the pressure off ourselves for a bit longer while also reducing the number of players that might suspect us."
"Marius : I understand your rationale, but I still think Andrei could become a bigger threat as the game progresses. However, if you're both inclined toward Cristina, I can support that choice. Let's go with the majority for now to keep it unified."
"Michael : Let's target Cristina then."

"system : Day2 start"
"system : Cristina dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Lucian : It's unfortunate that Cristina was eliminated last night. We need to discuss who might have been responsible and figure out any clues that could indicate who the Mafia is. Who does everyone suspect? Let's share our thoughts and observations."
"Marius : I think we should consider the players who were most engaged in discussions yesterday. Andrei and Viktor have both taken the lead in sharing their thoughts, which could indicate that they're trying to misdirect our focus. We should keep an eye on them and see if any patterns emerge in their behavior."
"Andrei : It's crucial that we remain rational and not jump to conclusions based on initial impressions. Marius, while I see where you're coming from, leading with suspicion towards the most vocal players can sometimes backfire. We should also consider the dynamics of the discussions and how everyone reacted. I think we should discuss how each of us feels about the recent events and maybe even consider who benefited from Cristina's elimination."
"Viktor : I agree with Andrei that we need to analyze the situation more deeply. While I understand the suspicions around Andrei and Viktor, we should also consider who might have benefited the most from Cristina's elimination. Let's examine everyone's actions and motivations before jumping to conclusions."
"Michael : I think it's important to focus on who has been steering the conversation and trying to redirect suspicions. While Marius and Andrei have been vocal, we should also watch out for those who might be blending in too seamlessly, like Lucian or Alexia. They could be attempting to avoid suspicion while having a strategic agenda."
"Viktor : I think we should consider both the vocal players and those who are blending in. While Marius and Andrei have been leading the discussion, we shouldn't overlook how others have responded. It's vital to analyze the interactions closely and see if anyone is attempting to manipulate the narrative. Let's focus on gathering more observations before jumping to any conclusions."
"Andrei : I think it's important to assess the reactions of everyone following Cristina's elimination. While Marius and Michael are directing suspicions, we need to pay attention to the dynamics and how others respond. I suggest we focus on gathering more thoughts on who has been steering the conversation versus those who are less vocal. Let's keep an open mind and collaborate to identify any inconsistencies."
"Marius : I think we should also pay attention to how everyone is interacting now that Cristina is gone. It's important to recognize any unusual dynamics or attempts to mislead the group. Let\u2019s be cautious about voicing too many accusations without solid evidence, but I still feel like we should keep a close eye on Michael and Lucian, as they seem to be steering the discussion while maintaining a low profile."
"Andrei : I think we need to focus on Michael and Lucian as potential suspects. Their approach seems calculated, and it may be a strategy to blend in while directing our attention elsewhere. We should keep the discussion open and gather more insights before voting."
"Michael : I think it's time we consider voting for Andrei. His consistent focus on others and pushing the narrative makes me suspicious. Let's see if we can rally support for that."

"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Andrei : I understand the suspicion against me, but I assure you that my focus has always been on seeking the truth and identifying the Mafia. Accusations can easily mislead us, and while I may have directed conversations, it's to encourage careful analysis of everyone\u2019s behavior. I urge you all to rethink your decision and consider the possibility of misdirection instead. Let's work together for the good of the Citizens."

"system : Day3 start"
"system : Viktor dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Alexia : It's unfortunate that Viktor was eliminated last night. We need to reassess our suspicions now that we've lost another Citizen. We should discuss how everyone reacted to today's events and share our thoughts on possible Mafia members. Who do you all think is suspicious? Let's use this opportunity to gather more insights."
"Marius : I think we should examine how the remaining players are reacting to Viktor's elimination. I've noticed that both Lucian and Dracula have been quieter since the last vote. That might be a tactic to avoid raising suspicion. Alexia, what are your thoughts on them?"
"Lucian : I've also noticed that Lucian and Dracula have been quieter recently. It's crucial to analyze their behavior and see if they are trying to avoid suspicion or if they are genuinely focusing on finding the Mafia. We should encourage them to share their thoughts more openly. Let's not overlook anyone's reactions and ensure we're considering all possibilities."
"Dracula : I agree that we need to scrutinize everyone, including Marius and Alexia. However, I've investigated both Michael and Marius during the night phases, and I've confirmed that both are Mafia members. We must focus on Michael now, as he poses a significant threat to our group. Let's discuss our votes accordingly."
"Michael : I think Dracula's claim about investigating Marius and me is highly suspicious. It seems like an attempt to deflect attention from his own actions. We need to be cautious of jumping on such accusations without any evidence. Let's focus on gathering more information before we decide on our next steps."
"Lucian : I think we need to be cautious about Dracula's accusations without concrete evidence. Since we have lost more Citizens, we need to focus on gathering insights from everyone. We should consider voting for Michael, but we must also inspect Dracula's claims further. Let's discuss and analyze how each of us has contributed to the game so far."
"Dracula : I have investigated both Marius and Michael, and both are Mafia members. We need to focus on eliminating Michael now. Your safety depends on getting rid of the actual threats."
"Lucian : I think we need to be methodical about our next steps. While Dracula makes bold claims, we should still verify his accusations against Michael. Let\u2019s discuss everyone\u2019s observations and determine a course of action based on our collective insights. We need to make sure we're not mistaken about who the real Mafia members are."
"Marius : I think we need to consider the possibility that Dracula could be manipulating us. His claims about investigating both Michael and me could be a tactic to divert suspicion away from himself. Let's focus on gathering more observations and assessing everyone\u2019s contributions before making any final decisions. We should remain cautious with accusations and ensure we\u2019re voting based on solid grounds."
"Lucian : I think we should carefully evaluate both Dracula's claims and Michael's actions. It seems we've entered a critical point where we cannot risk making a decision without sufficient evidence. Let's share more observations about each other to ensure we make the best choice moving forward."

"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Michael : I understand the concerns surrounding my role, but I assure you I have been focused on finding the Mafia. The accusations against me stem from fear and uncertainty, especially after losing two Citizens. I encourage you to reflect on the discussions and consider the real motives behind Dracula\u2019s claims. It\u2019s crucial that we do not eliminate based on assumptions, as making a hasty decision may cost the remaining Citizens dearly. Let\u2019s take time to assess all evidence before making a final choice."

"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Dracula : It's unfortunate that Lucian was eliminated last night. We are now down to only three players. I want to remind everyone that I've consistently investigated Marius, and he is Mafia. Given the information in hand, it is crucial to recognize that Marius is a threat to the remaining Citizens, and we must focus on eliminating him now. Let's not make the same mistake again and act decisively to ensure our victory!"
"Alexia : I appreciate Dracula's claims, but we must still proceed with caution. Marius has been a vocal player, and we should thoroughly assess his behavior before jumping to conclusions. Let's discuss our observations and ensure we're making a well-informed decision."
"Marius : I understand the concerns, but I believe Dracula's accusations are misguided. While he's been vocal about his supposed investigations, we need to question the validity of his claims. His focus on eliminating me seems more like an attempt to shift attention away from himself. Let's take a moment to consider the nature of his allegations before jumping to conclusions. We need to ensure we\u2019re voting based on concrete evidence and not just on unverified statements."
"Alexia : I believe we need to thoroughly evaluate both Dracula's claims and Marius's defense before making a decision. However, we cannot overlook the possibility that Dracula could be manipulating us with his accusations. Let's discuss further and share our insights so we can make an informed choice."
"Marius : While I understand the concerns about my role, I urge everyone to reconsider Dracula's accusations. They seem highly targeted and may be a strategy to deflect suspicion from himself. Let\u2019s analyze the situation without jumping to conclusions just based on his claims. Now that we are down to just three players, making a hasty decision could cost us the game."
"Alexia : I believe it's crucial that we carefully consider both sides of this situation. While Dracula claims he has investigated Marius, we need to ensure that his accusations aren't a diversion. Let's vote based on what we truly believe rather than solely on allegations. I suggest we vote to eliminate Dracula, as we haven\u2019t fully vetted his claims yet and he could potentially be misleading us."
"Marius : I believe voting for Dracula at this stage is a mistake. His consistent claims about my role, without any solid evidence, are concerning. We need to be sure before taking such significant action. I suggest we focus on gathering more insight before making our final vote, as hasty decisions can lead us to further losses."
"Alexia : I believe we need to take action based on the evidence presented. I vote to eliminate Dracula, as I\u2019m concerned that his accusations may be an attempt to deflect suspicion from himself. Let\u2019s move forward decisively to protect the remaining Citizens."
"Marius : I strongly believe that eliminating Dracula right now is a mistake. His claims and process of elimination towards me seem like an attempt to mislead us. We must consider the potential consequences of this vote. I urge everyone to rethink their choice carefully and gather more insights before we take such a significant action."
"Alexia : I vote to eliminate Dracula."
"system : It's time to vote!"
"system : Vote result is{'Marius': ['Dracula'], 'Alexia': [], 'Dracula': ['Marius', 'Alexia']}"
"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Dracula : I understand the accusations against me, but I assure you I am on the side of the Citizens. My investigations have confirmed that Marius is Mafia, as I have investigated him multiple times. Please reconsider your decision. Eliminating me would allow the remaining Mafia to win. Trust in the evidence I've gathered and let's secure our victory for the Citizens together."
"system : It's time for final vote!"
