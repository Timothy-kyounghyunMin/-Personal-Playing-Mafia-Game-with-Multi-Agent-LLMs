"Selene : I'm truly saddened to hear about Michael's elimination. Losing valuable players so quickly raises questions about who might benefit from these actions. Emil and Mircea, you both seem eager to strategize\u2014what\u2019s your take on this? Additionally, we should definitely consider those who are speaking the least. Lucian and Alexia have been notably quiet. Shouldn\u2019t we discuss their silence and what it might mean for our investigation?"
"Emil : I agree with Selene that we need to discuss the quieter players, particularly Lucian and Alexia. Their silence could suggest they are trying to stay under the radar, which is concerning. I propose we ask them directly about their views on Michael's elimination and any suspicions they may have. Also, let's keep a close watch on how everyone votes, as this can reveal alliances and potential Mafia behavior. Gathering more information is essential for our decision-making."
"Lucian : I completely agree with Selene and Emil on focusing on the quieter players like Alexia and myself. Alexia, what are your thoughts on Michael's elimination?

Do you have any suspicions or observations to share? It\u2019s crucial that we gather everyone\u2019s insights to help us navigate this situation effectively."
"Lucian : I believe it's crucial for us to engage more deeply with each player. Since Alexia brought up my thoughts, I feel Michael\u2019s elimination may indicate that the Mafia is attempting to disrupt our discussions. While I don't have strong suspicions yet, I'm keeping a close watch on how everyone reacts to accusations. We must ensure that all players share their insights to spot any inconsistencies.

Furthermore, we should ask the players who voted for Michael to clarify their reasoning, as this could help reveal any suspicious behavior. By encouraging this dialogue, we can make informed decisions and effectively identify any potential Mafia members among us."

We should examine their reactions and analyze what happened with Emil\u2019s vote. I\u2019d like to hear everyone\u2019s thoughts on this."
"Cristina : It's unfortunate to lose Emil, and I agree that we need to analyze the dynamics closely. While it's easy to suspect those who lead discussions, I think we should also highlight the quieter players who might be influencing our perceptions from the background. Selene, since you've raised concerns about Mircea and me, let's focus on any inconsistencies we notice\u2014particularly in voting patterns. It's essential that we ensure no one is misleading us. Additionally, we should examine how quieter players have been participating and whether their silence"
"Mircea : I share the disappointment of losing Emil, and it's essential that we scrutinize the voting patterns closely. Building on Selene's concerns about Cristina and me, I encourage everyone\u2014both active and quieter players\u2014to share their insights. We need to identify any discrepancies in behavior or potential alliances that may reveal the Mafia. Let's collaborate and ensure each person contributes to this discussion to gather as much valuable information as possible before we vote."

Cristina's actions, in particular, seem to highlight Mircea while trying to deflect attention from herself. I urge everyone to share their insights, and we should be vigilant of any manipulative behavior. It\u2019s crucial we closely scrutinize Cristina\u2019s statements and align them with the actions of quieter players, and I propose we examine voting patterns to identify any inconsistencies."
"Cristina : I need to clarify my position regarding the current discussion. I am the Police and have investigated Andrei during the night, discovering he is Mafia. This is critical information for our next steps. Selene seems to be shifting focus onto me, which could be an attempt to divert suspicion from herself. We must unite in our effort to eliminate the Mafia, beginning with Andrei. It's important we stay vigilant and make informed choices based on the evidence at hand."
"Andrei : Cristina's claim raises some red flags; if she really is the Police, why hasn\u2019t she acted sooner against a known Mafia? It\u2019s important we scrutinize her methods and dive deeper into her role. Furthermore, focusing on Mircea and me shouldn\u2019t overshadow the need to examine the quieter players like Lucian and Alexia.
