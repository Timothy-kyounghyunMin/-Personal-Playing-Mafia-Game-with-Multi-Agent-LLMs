"Viktor : Ileana, your defensiveness raises significant concerns about your role.

I urge everyone to bring up any suspicious behaviors or interactions they've noticed in others, as this collaborative approach will lead us to a more well-rounded understanding of the situation."
"Viktor : Given the strong evidence from my investigation, it's crucial that we take action to eliminate the Mafia threat posed by Ileana, who I can confirm is one of them. I urge everyone to recognize the urgency of this situation and support the vote for her elimination, ensuring the safety of all remaining Citizens. Let's stay focused and act decisively!"
