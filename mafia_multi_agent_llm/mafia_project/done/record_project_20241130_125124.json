I encourage everyone to share their thoughts on any suspicious behavior or unusual voting patterns we've noticed. Let's work together and piece together our observations to identify potential Mafia members. Who has insights to share?"
"Cristina : It's truly unfortunate that Selene is gone. We should closely examine how everyone interacted with her before her elimination and share insights on any unusual alliances or voting patterns. I echo Semira's point; let's discuss anyone who appeared overly defensive or evasive, as their behavior may help us identify potential Mafia members."
"Emil : I believe we should reflect on our past discussions, specifically examining players who seemed overly quiet or hesitant in their responses, as their reluctance to engage could indicate guilt. Additionally, let\u2019s consider those who quickly deflected suspicion from Selene or formed strong alliances with her; they may be trying to protect a fellow Mafia member. I encourage everyone to share observations we've made to help guide our next steps."
"Vladimir : I agree with everyone\u2019s insights thus far. It's crucial to consider players who were quiet or overly defensive while Selene was here. We should also analyze any alliances that may have formed around her. I\u2019d like to build on Emil's observation regarding those who deflected suspicion from her, as they could be trying to protect a potential Mafia member. Let\u2019s gather our thoughts and see if we can pinpoint any behaviors that raise red flags."
"Emil : Let's focus our discussion on the interactions between Selene and the other players in the days leading up to her elimination.

"Cristina : We should analyze the interactions between Selene and the other players leading up to her elimination. Let\u2019s focus on individuals who were overly protective of her or remained quiet during discussions, as their behavior could reveal patterns suggesting Mafia affiliation. I urge everyone to share their observations so we can effectively identify and discuss potential suspects together."
"Emil : We should critically analyze the actions of players who were quiet or evasive during discussions about Selene. Specifically, those who deflected attention away from her need scrutiny. Let's highlight any suspicious behaviors we observed, as this could help us identify potential Mafia members and narrow down our suspects together. Who fits these patterns?"
"Alexia : I propose we scrutinize Emil more closely. His intense focus on analyzing previous discussions and his tendency to deflect attention may indicate he's trying to shield someone. Let's delve into his behavior and see if it raises any concerns for the group."
"Emil : I appreciate your perspective, Alexia. It\u2019s important to clarify that my goal is to keep our discussions focused on identifying suspicious behaviors rather than deflecting suspicion. Can you share any specific instances that led to your concerns about me? Let\u2019s work together to analyze everyone's actions critically and uncover potential Mafia members as a team."
"Alexia : Emil's recent behavior strikes me as quite suspicious. He appears overly intent on scrutinizing others while deflecting attention from himself, which might indicate he has something to hide. Let\u2019s keep a close watch on him, as his defensive nature suggests he could be protecting someone within the group. It's essential that we stay vigilant and focus our suspicions on those who truly might be part of the Mafia."

Let's build on that observation by reviewing interactions from the previous day. I suspect players who were overly supportive of Selene or Emil prior to their exit. Does anyone have thoughts on suspicious behaviors we should investigate further?"

"Michael : I understand the concerns raised about both Cristina and me, but let\u2019s remember the importance of analyzing the actions of all players. If we focus too narrowly on just a couple of individuals, we might overlook key patterns that could reveal the true Mafia.

"Michael : I urge everyone to take a closer look at the behaviors of Alexia and Vladimir, who have been very vocal in their suspicions. Their repeated accusations may be a strategy to divert attention from their own actions. Let\u2019s thoroughly analyze their interactions and voting patterns, as this could help us uncover the true Mafia among us."
"Vladimir : I believe it's crucial that we analyze the voting patterns from the previous days, especially focusing on who was defensive regarding Selene and Emil.
