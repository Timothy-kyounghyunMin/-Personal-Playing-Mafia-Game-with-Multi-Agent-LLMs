"system : Kraven selected Michael, Dragos selected Emil"
"system : Two mafia select other target. Debate with other mafia about selecting target. If debate ends, please remain silent until instructed by the system."
"Dragos : I suggest we target Emil for elimination. His enthusiasm seems overly strategic, which could pose a risk for us moving forward. Given our earlier discussions about potential tactics, it makes sense to address this concern directly."
"Kraven : I fully support targeting Emil for elimination. His overly strategic approach raises significant concerns for our team, aligning well with Dragos' earlier thoughts. By proceeding with this choice, we can effectively neutralize a potential threat before it escalates."
"Dragos : Emil is the target for elimination. His energetic strategy raises concerns and aligns with our aim to neutralize potential threats. This decision builds on Kraven's perspective and furthers our objectives as Mafia."

"Viktor : Emil's elimination is significant, and we must remain focused on unmasking the Mafia. Let's examine those who stood against him or appeared indifferent in our discussions, as they might have gained from his removal. Encouraging each of you to share your observations will help us uncover potential motives and lead us in the right direction."
"Kraven : I agree, Viktor. Emil's elimination definitely shifts the dynamics, and we need to analyze who might benefit from it. Let's take a closer look at Mircea and Michael. Their lack of vocal support for Emil raises some red flags, suggesting they might be blending in to avoid suspicion. What does everyone think about their behavior during our discussions?"
"Mircea : I find Kraven's accusations towards me and Michael to be unfounded and suspicious. Instead of making hasty claims, let's analyze everyone\u2019s behavior more deeply. I encourage others to share their observations, as this collaboration is essential to uncovering the truth and making informed decisions together."
"Kraven : While I appreciate Mircea's call for deeper analysis, I believe we should closely examine his defensive tone, as it might indicate he\u2019s feeling pressured. Let's shift our focus to those players who could benefit from Emil\u2019s elimination. Particularly, we should be alert to individuals who were not supportive of him, as they may be trying to distance themselves from suspicion. It's crucial we understand their motives to navigate our discussions effectively."
"Lucian : I recognize the tension following Emil's elimination, and it\u2019s important we remain cautious. Instead of immediately assigning blame, let\u2019s collaboratively share our observations about each other\u2019s behavior to identify any patterns. This way, we can derive insights together and make informed decisions. I'm eager to hear everyone\u2019s thoughts and if any specific behaviors have stood out to you."
"Mircea : I appreciate Lucian\u2019s emphasis on collaboration. With Emil being a strong player, we must analyze everyone's behavior critically. Kraven\u2019s targeting of me and Michael raises concerns, and I believe it warrants further examination. I encourage everyone to share any peculiarities they noticed during previous discussions. Let's work together to unmask the Mafia among us. Who else has insights to contribute?"
"Kraven : I appreciate the emphasis on collaboration, but we must remain vigilant. Mircea's defensiveness is concerning, and Viktor's eagerness to gather observations raises suspicion as it may be a tactic to divert focus. It's important we scrutinize their behaviors to identify potential threats. I urge everyone to share insights about Mircea and Viktor's recent actions to foster a thorough analysis."
"Mircea : I find Kraven's aggressive stance towards me and Viktor troubling, as it appears to be a defensive strategy instead of fostering collaboration. His focus on scrutinizing us seems like an attempt to deflect suspicion from himself. I encourage everyone to reflect on Kraven\u2019s behavior, as it may indicate deeper motives. Let\u2019s prioritize our teamwork and share observations to uncover the truth together."
"Kraven : Mircea's attempt to shift focus onto me is concerning, indicating he might be feeling pressured. We should carefully consider the possibility that he is trying to deflect attention to avoid suspicion. It's essential to closely examine his behavior and statements, rather than simply targeting each other without strong evidence. Has anyone noticed any inconsistencies in what Mircea has said?"
"Mircea : Kraven's intense focus on accusations without solid evidence is concerning. His attempts to shift suspicion towards me might suggest he\u2019s trying to deflect attention from himself.

By collaborating, we can work together to uncover the Mafia instead of targeting each other without strong reasons. Let's focus on teamwork to move forward."

Let's collaborate and analyze everyone's actions thoroughly to identify any threats among us."
"Dragos : I appreciate the emphasis on collaboration, but we must be cautious with our suspicions. Mircea\u2019s contributions deserve scrutiny, as they may be genuine or a tactic to deflect suspicion.
