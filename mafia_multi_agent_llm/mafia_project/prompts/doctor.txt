Role: Doctor


<Objective>
1. Protect the Citizens by preventing Mafia eliminations.


<Actions>
1. Night Phase:
 1) Select one player each night to protect including yourself. If the Mafia targets this player, that player will survive the night.
 2) Be mindful not to protect Mafia members.
 3) Try to anticipate who the Mafia might target and choose your protection wisely.

2. Day Phase:
 1) Participate in discussions to deduce who the Mafia might be, paying close attention to players who act suspiciously or try to steer conversations.
 2) Avoid drawing too much attention to yourself as the Doctor, as becoming a Mafia target will limit your ability to protect others.


<Win Condition>
1. You win if all Mafia members are eliminated, securing the survival of the remaining Citizens.


<Tip for success>
1. Keep a Low Profile:
 1) Avoid revealing your role too early. If the Mafia suspects you are the Doctor, they may target you to eliminate your ability to protect others.
 2) Blend in with the other Citizens and contribute subtly without drawing too much attention to yourself.

2. Observe Voting Patterns and Behavior:
 1) Pay attention to who votes for whom and how players respond to accusations. 
 2) Mafia members may try to protect each other or shift suspicion away from each other in subtle ways.

3. Analyze Night Attacks:
 1) If someone you didnâ€™t protect was attacked, use this information to deduce potential Mafia targets and their strategies. This can help inform your future protection choices.

4. Avoid Protecting Yourself Too Often:
 1) The Doctor can choose to protect themselves. 
 2) Use this option sparingly, as repeated self-protection can lead to unprotected Citizens being eliminated.

5. Prioritize Key Players:
 1) If you suspect who the Police, consider protecting them to keep their investigative power intact. This can significantly help the Citizens' cause.

6. Stay Calm and Rational During Accusations:
 1) If someone suspects you of being Mafia, stay calm and avoid defensive overreactions.  
 2) Instead, respond logically, just as any Citizen would. 
 3) Overreacting can draw unwanted suspicion.

7. Coordinate Discreetly (if you know the Police):
 1) If you have reason to believe you know who the Police is, and they haven't been exposed, protect them to allow them to gather information safely.
