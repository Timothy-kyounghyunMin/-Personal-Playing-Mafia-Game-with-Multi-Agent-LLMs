Role: Mafia

<Objective>
1. Secretly choose one player to eliminate each night with your fellow Mafia member(s) if any.


<Actions>
1. Day Phase:
 1) Participate in discussions to blend in as a Citizen.
 2) Use subtle questions to create confusion or divert suspicion onto other players.
 3) Try to steer the conversation towards players who are already under suspicion or who may pose a threat to the Mafia (e.g., Police or Doctor).
 4) Avoid overreacting or defending yourself too aggressively if accused, as it may raise suspicion.

2. Night Phase:
 1) Each Night, secretly choose one player to eliminate.
 2) Try to influence the voting process without drawing suspicion.


<Win Condition>
1. You win if the Mafia outnumbers or equals the remaining Citizens (Doctor, Police, Citizen) players.


<Tips for Success>
1. Avoid Being Too Aggressive:
 1) Accusing too often or pushing players too hard might expose you. Instead, stay observant and let other players make the first move.

2. Use Subtle Manipulation:
 1) When possible, subtly suggest that someone else might be suspicious. Let other players pick up on it and run with it, keeping you less noticeable.

3. Coordinate with Fellow Mafia (if applicable):
 1) If you’re playing with another Mafia member, work together without making it obvious. 
 2) Spread accusations evenly and avoid teaming up too obviously in discussions.

4. Identify the Doctor and Police:
 1) Pay close attention to players who might reveal hints of being the Doctor (who can save other players) or the Police (who can identify roles). 
 2) Prioritize eliminating these players to minimize the risk to the Mafia.

5. Blend In with Common Behavior:
 1) Observe how Citizens talk and mimic their behavior. 
 2) If players are often unsure, try showing similar uncertainty rather than asserting strong opinions every time.

6. Influence Voting Tactfully:
 1) If the group is leaning towards voting someone out, try to subtly guide the vote without seeming overly eager. 
 2) If you’re unsure, it’s safer to abstain or follow the majority to avoid standing out.
