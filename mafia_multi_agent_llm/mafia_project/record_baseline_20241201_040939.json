"system : Day2 start"
"system : The Mafia tried to kill someone, but the doctor saved him/her. No one died last night!"
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Dragos : It's interesting that no one was eliminated last night, which might indicate that the Doctor successfully protected someone. This gives us a chance to reconsider our suspicions and focus on gathering more information. I think we should discuss who we believe could be part of the Mafia based on yesterday's conversations and voting patterns. Who do you all think we should consider?"
"Selene : It\u2019s curious that the Doctor managed to save someone last night. We should consider who might have been the target. I feel like we should pay attention to Kraven and Semira; they seemed a bit defensive during our introductions. What do you all think?"
"Kraven : I understand Selene's concerns, but I think we should be cautious about jumping to conclusions based solely on defensiveness. Let's gather more insights from everyone's observations. I would suggest we discuss all players equally and look for consistent patterns in behavior that could indicate Mafia tendencies. What does everyone else think?"
"Selene : I think Kraven makes a good point about being cautious. However, we also need to be mindful of any players who might be trying to deflect attention from themselves. I suggest we keep an eye on Stefan and Vladimir; their eagerness to collaborate could be a way to blend in without drawing suspicion. What does everyone else think?"
"Semira : I think we should remain cautious and analyze everyone's behavior more closely. While Selene and Kraven have valid points, we need to ensure we're not pointing fingers without sufficient evidence. I agree with keeping an eye on Stefan and Vladimir, but I also suggest we consider Larisa and Ileana since they haven't been mentioned much in our discussions. Let's see if they have any insights or observations to share."
"Ileana : I agree with Semira that we should be cautious in our accusations. It's important to gather more insights from everyone. I think it would be beneficial to ask Larisa about her thoughts on the current situation since she hasn't contributed much yet. What do you think, Larisa?"
"Larisa : I think it's important for everyone to share their thoughts openly. I agree with Ileana that gathering more perspectives is helpful. I would be interested to hear what Stefan and Vladimir think about who might be suspicious, as they haven't spoken much yet in this discussion."
"Stefan : I think it's important for us to remain vigilant during these discussions. I've been paying attention to the dynamics, and I agree that we shouldn't jump to conclusions. However, I do find the focus on Kraven and Semira interesting, as both are suggesting caution. I also find Larisa's and Ileana's restraint in contributing a bit concerning. It might be useful for all of us to be more vocal and share our thoughts. Let's keep probing for anyone trying to deflect suspicion."
"Kraven : I appreciate everyone's input, and I believe we should focus on analyzing behavior rather than making premature accusations. I'm still concerned about Larisa and Ileana's quieter contributions. However, I also think it\u2019s important to keep a balanced approach. I'd like to hear more from them before we decide on anyone to suspect or vote against. Let's keep discussing and see if more patterns emerge."
"Larisa : I understand the importance of discussing behaviors and contributions. I appreciate Kraven's point about wanting to hear more from those who have been quieter, including myself. However, I also think we should pay attention to how quickly some players are trying to steer the conversation. It could be beneficial to focus on those who seem eager to deflect suspicion, like Selene, who has been quite vocal in directing attention towards others. Let's continue to evaluate everyone closely."

"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Selene : I find it concerning that the focus has shifted towards me without solid evidence. I\u2019ve been trying to encourage open discussions and gather insights from everyone. Jumping to conclusions can lead us to wrong accusations. I urge everyone to reflect on how quickly suspicions can arise and consider whether I'm truly a threat or just a scapegoat to divert attention from actual Mafia members. Let's stay cautious and continue seeking the truth together."

"system : Vladimir dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Ileana : With Vladimir's death, we are now down a valuable voice. It\u2019s essential that we analyze his last contributions and the dynamics of our discussions. We successfully eliminated Selene, a member of the Mafia, but we need to remain cautious. I suggest we look closely at Larisa and Dragos, as they both have been relatively quiet in their reactions and contributions recently. Let's share our suspicions and decide how to move forward."
"Larisa : I think we need to carefully assess the situation. While Ileana brings up valid points regarding Larisa and Dragos, I believe we should also consider whether anyone is trying to steer the conversation too directly. Let's not jump to conclusions without solid reasoning. I suggest focusing on gathering insights from everyone before making any accusations or votes. What do you all think?"
"Ileana : I see the point that we should gather more insights, but we must also consider that we are running out of time to identify the remaining Mafia. My investigations thus far show that Kraven is not Mafia, and with Vladimir now dead, we should evaluate who was closely aligned with him. I suggest we focus the discussions on Dragos, as he has been quite vocal in trying to steer the conversation, and we must ensure that we're not being misled. Let's delve deeper into his behavior and see if"
"Kraven : I think it's important to analyze how everyone is participating in the discussions. While I agree that Dragos has been vocal, it\u2019s essential to also consider the dynamics of the conversations and who seems to be deflecting attention. I believe we should closely observe both Larisa and Dragos since they are both being highlighted in suspicions, but we must not forget about the quiet ones who may be trying to fly under the radar, like Semira. Let's gather everyone's thoughts before making a decision."
"Dragos : I think it's crucial that we remain vigilant during these discussions. While I understand the points made about both Larisa and myself, I believe we need to focus on consistent behaviors across the board. I would like to reiterate the importance of examining Semira closely as well, since she hasn't been very vocal. We cannot afford to overlook anyone, especially those who may be trying to blend in. Let's continue discussing openly and analyze how everyone is contributing."
"Semira : I believe we should not rush into any accusations without solid evidence. While Dragos' vocal presence is worth noting, we must also consider the quieter players like Larisa and myself. We should share our thoughts openly and analyze how each of us has interacted in discussions. I suggest we take a moment to reflect on our findings and decide how to proceed carefully."
"Larisa : I believe we need to focus on analyzing the behaviors of all players, but I find Dragos' consistent attempts to redirect the conversation concerning. It could be a tactic to deflect suspicion away from himself. Let's also remember to evaluate Semira's quieter contributions, as they can sometimes hide a Mafia member. I encourage everyone to share their observations and let\u2019s carefully consider our next steps."
"Ileana : I believe we should focus on analyzing Dragos' consistent attempts to redirect the conversation, which could be a tactic to deflect suspicion. Additionally, while Semira has been quieter, I think it's essential for us to consider all players actively. However, since I have confirmed that Kraven is not Mafia, he should not be a target for suspicion right now. I propose we direct our attention back to Dragos, as his behavior has raised concerns. Let's discuss whether we believe he should be closely scrutin"
"Kraven : I think it's important for us to direct our focus toward Dragos, as his attempts to steer the conversation and redirect suspicions raise red flags. While Semira's quieter role is worth considering, we need to prioritize analyzing Dragos' behavior further, especially since he has been actively engaging in discussions without solid reasoning. Let's consider the implications of his actions before making our next move."
"Dragos : I find it concerning that we're directing so much suspicion toward me without solid evidence. While I acknowledge the need for scrutiny, I believe we also need to be careful not to overlook the quieter players like Semira and Larisa. I propose we keep discussing and look for consistent patterns across all players' behaviors before we decide on any votes. Let's ensure our discussions remain open and inclusive to gather as much information as possible."

"Dragos : I find it concerning that I'm being targeted without solid evidence. I've actively participated in conversations to gather insight and analyze everyone\u2019s behavior. While I understand the need for scrutiny, it\u2019s crucial that we consider the overall contributions of all players, not just focusing on one individual. I urge everyone to reflect on their observations and not to rush into accusations. We must remain united and focused on identifying the true Mafia members among us."

"system : Semira is not mafia"
"system : Day4 start"
"system : Semira dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Kraven : With Semira's death, we have lost another potential voice in our discussions. It's crucial for us to analyze her previous contributions and see if there were any patterns. We need to focus our suspicions on the players still remaining, particularly on Larisa and Ileana, as both have been in the spotlight recently. I believe we should reevaluate their roles and consider if we might be overlooking any clear signs. Let's discuss this openly and see if we can draw any conclusions from the remaining actions and conversations"
"Larisa : I think we need to focus on analyzing the behaviors of the remaining players. While Kraven is making some good points, we should also consider the dynamics of our discussions and see if anyone is trying to feign concern to distract us from the real Mafia members. I believe that both Kraven and Ileana should be under scrutiny as their arguments may be tactics to deflect attention away from themselves. Let's continue discussing and make sure we share our observations comprehensively."
"Ileana : I believe we need to focus on whom we suspect based on actual evidence. My investigations have shown that both Vladimir and Kraven are not Mafia. Given that Semira is now dead and was not Mafia, we should pay close attention to Larisa's behavior and motivations. I think we should discuss her contributions more deeply before moving forward with any votes."
"Larisa : I think it's important to evaluate the motivations behind everyone's contributions. While Ileana\u2019s points are noteworthy, it seems like a tactic to divert attention from her own role. I suggest we consider the actions and words of both Kraven and Ileana closely. Let\u2019s discuss whether there are any patterns that indicate where true suspicions lie before making a decision."
"Ileana : I believe we should focus our suspicions on Larisa. Both Kraven and I have been confirmed as citizens and have not exhibited any Mafia behavior. Larisa's attempts to redirect our discussions toward Kraven and me seem like a tactic to deflect attention. We must consider the possibility that she may be trying to conceal her role. Let's discuss her actions more closely before we make any decisions."
"Kraven : I think we need to focus on Larisa\u2019s behavior closely. Her attempts to shift the blame to Ileana and me are concerning, especially given the current dynamics. We should analyze her contributions and patterns carefully before we decide anything. Let's discuss whether her actions indicate that she might be the remaining Mafia member."
"Ileana : I believe we should vote for Larisa. Based on her attempts to deflect suspicion and mislead our discussions, she seems to be the remaining Mafia member. Let's proceed with the vote."
"Kraven : I am in agreement with voting for Larisa. Her behavior has raised enough suspicion, and we need to take action to eliminate the remaining Mafia member. Let's proceed with the vote."
"Ileana : I vote for Larisa."
"Larisa : I find it puzzling that my actions are being scrutinized while Ileana seems to be deflecting attention away from herself. It\u2019s crucial that we reevaluate who has been directing suspicion. Let's not overlook the possibility that there are ulterior motives behind the discussions. I encourage everyone to think carefully before making a decision."
"system : It's time to vote!"
"system : Vote result is{'Stefan': [], 'Larisa': ['Stefan', 'Kraven', 'Ileana'], 'Kraven': [], 'Ileana': ['Larisa']}"
"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Larisa : I believe it is unfair that I am being targeted without solid evidence. I have contributed to our discussions and encouraged a thorough analysis of everyone's behavior. Accusations should be based on clear patterns, not merely on perception. I urge everyone to reflect on their conclusions and consider whether there may be motivations behind the accusations being directed at me. We must stay united in identifying the true Mafia members among us, and I urge you to reconsider your decision before it's too late."
