"system : Michael selected Selene, Marius selected Andrei"
"system : Two mafia select other target. Debate with other mafia about selecting target. If debate ends, please remain silent until instructed by the system."
"Michael : I think we should stick with Selene as the target. Andrei might have potential as the Police or Doctor, while Selene hasn\u2019t stood out yet. Let's eliminate her this round."
"Marius : I see your point, but I think it's worth considering that if we take out Andrei, it'll reduce the chances of losing a potential Doctor or Police role. However, I can go along with the majority if you all think Selene is the safer choice. Let's finalize our target."
"Michael : Let's go with Selene. I believe she's the safer option for now. We can reassess if necessary in the future."

"system : Day2 start"
"system : Selene dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Andrei : It's unfortunate that Selene was eliminated last night. We need to be careful and discuss who might be targeting our Citizens. Does anyone have any suspicions about who could be part of the Mafia?"
"Marius : I think we should keep an open eye on Michael. He seems pretty eager to discuss strategy, which can be a red flag. We should also consider that Selene might have been innocent, so let's be cautious about how we proceed with our discussions."
"Kraven : I understand Marius' concern about Michael, but I think we should also consider the possibility that the Mafia could be trying to blend in with the group. We need to observe everyone's behavior closely, including their reactions to accusations. My suspicion currently lies with Marius, as he seems quick to point fingers. Let's keep our discussions open and weigh all angles before making a decision."
"Michael : I understand the concerns about Michael, but I think we need to consider that pointing fingers too quickly can lead us astray. Let's look at the bigger picture and think critically about everyone's actions. Marius might be trying to deflect attention from himself by making accusations."
"Cristina : I understand the suspicions being raised regarding Michael and Marius, but we need to remember that quick accusations can sometimes be a tactic used by the Mafia to stir confusion. I would suggest we consider everyone's behavior carefully before jumping to conclusions. It's important for us to focus on observing patterns among the group."
"Andrei : I understand the need to consider everyone's actions carefully, but I want to point out that quick accusations can lead us to make mistakes. Both Marius and Michael have raised valid points, but we should focus on observing the voting patterns and behaviors more closely. I suspect that the real Mafia might be hiding in the shadows and could be playing innocent. Let\u2019s keep discussing and analyzing our observations."
"Cristina : I agree that we need to be cautious with our accusations. However, I think we should also consider how each person's behavior has changed since Selene's elimination. It might be helpful to focus on those who seem to be steering the conversation away from key players, as they could be trying to avoid scrutiny. I suggest we keep a close eye on Marius and Michael during our discussions."
"Marius : I want to remind everyone that although there are valid suspicions being raised, we should focus on how players respond under pressure. It's important to remain vigilant and consider how people are reacting rather than just what they're saying. Let's keep observing and discussing, but I believe we should target those who seem overly defensive, like Michael."
"Michael : I think we should closely observe Semira. She hasn't strongly contributed to the discussion yet, and her lack of engagement could be a sign of trying to avoid detection. We need to ensure we're not being led astray by emotions and keep our eyes on those who are blending in too well."
"Cristina : I appreciate the suggestions about different players, but I think we should focus on who hasn't actively been contributing to the discussion. Semira's lack of input might be a concern, and it's important that we address this. I propose we investigate her further, as we need to ensure everyone is fully engaged in our efforts to identify the Mafia."

"Semira : I understand the suspicions surrounding me, but I assure you I'm just as invested in uncovering the Mafia as everyone else. I've been observing the discussions and trying to contribute thoughtfully. Instead of focusing on me, I encourage you to consider the behaviors and interactions of other players as well. We should work together to ensure the right choice is made for the safety of our Citizens."

"system : Day3 start"
"system : Cristina dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Kraven : It's unfortunate that Cristina was eliminated last night. We are down to just a few of us now. We need to analyze the discussions and choices made so far. I still have my suspicions about Marius. After the last vote, it seems that he\u2019s trying to steer blame onto others, specifically aiming at Michael. We should focus on who is trying to deflect attention rather than genuinely contribute to our discussions. Let's continue to share insights and make sure we're careful with our next moves."
"Marius : I understand the concerns about me, but I believe we should focus more on Kraven's consistent attempts to sway the group. His last statement seemed like a tactic to divert attention. We need to critically examine the players who are trying to lead discussions without solid reasoning behind their claims. I suggest we keep a watch on him as we deliberate on our next course of action."
"Andrei : I find both Kraven and Marius suspicious, but I think we need to look at who has consistently been driving the conversation. Given the eliminations so far, we should focus on Marius and his swift accusations toward others. It feels like he might be trying to divert attention away from himself. Let's consider our next steps carefully before making a decision."
"Marius : I appreciate the points raised, but we have to consider that Kraven is becoming overly defensive with his accusations. It's concerning that he's trying to shift the focus away from himself so actively. I suggest we closely observe his actions moving forward, as it could reveal more about his true intentions."
"Kraven : I think we need to focus on Marius. His accusations feel like a way to deflect suspicion from himself. We should closely evaluate his behavior and statements to see if he\u2019s trying to manipulate the group. Let\u2019s remain cautious and consider who is genuinely contributing versus those who are trying to lead without solid reasoning."
"Marius : I think we need to carefully evaluate Kraven's behavior, as he seems to be attempting to rally the group against me without presenting solid evidence. This kind of deflection can often hide a more manipulative agenda. It's crucial that we don't fall into the trap of quick accusations without due cause."
"Kraven : I believe we should focus our attention on Marius. His constant attempts to deflect blame onto others raise red flags for me. We need to analyze his motives and his behavior closely, as it feels like he is trying to manipulate our perceptions. Let's remain vigilant and consider who is genuinely contributing to our discussions."
"Andrei : I think we need to be cautious about both Kraven and Marius. While Marius is quick to point fingers, Kraven's defensiveness raises red flags for me. Given our situation, I urge everyone to closely evaluate their actions and contributions to our discussions. We can't afford to make a wrong decision at this stage. Let's ensure our next move is well thought out."
"Marius : I believe we should target Kraven. His behavior has been overly defensive, and he seems to be trying to control the narrative. This kind of manipulation can be indicative of someone trying to mask their true intentions. Let's focus our attention on him for our next decision."
"Andrei : I believe we should vote to eliminate Marius. His strategic deflection and attempts to control the narrative raise significant concerns. We need to ensure we are not being misled and focus on individuals who are actively trying to manipulate our discussions."

"Marius : I understand the suspicions surrounding me, but I want to emphasize that my focus has always been on trying to identify the true manipulator in our midst. It's easy to point fingers, but I assure you that I'm just as committed to uncovering the truth as anyone else. Let's not let emotions cloud our judgment. I encourage you to reconsider your vote and focus on the behavior of those who have been driving the conversation without solid evidence."

"system : The Mafia tried to kill someone, but the doctor saved him/her. No one died last night!"
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Kraven : It's a relief that no one was eliminated last night, giving us another chance to discuss and strategize. With Marius gone, we need to closely evaluate our remaining players: Larisa and Michael. I think we should focus on observing their behaviors and decide on our next move wisely. Let's share our thoughts and suspicions to ensure we identify the true Mafia member among us."
"Michael : I agree that we need to analyze the behaviors of Larisa and Andrei closely. I find Andrei's eagerness to point fingers suspicious, as it could be a tactic to deflect attention from himself. Let's consider how he has been leading the conversation and if he might be hiding something. Larisa has been quieter, but I think we should focus on Andrei's actions right now."
"Andrei : I understand the concerns about my behavior, but I believe we should focus more on Michael. His quick shift of suspicion toward me feels like an attempt to divert attention away from himself. I urge everyone to analyze his actions closely, as they may reveal more about his true intentions. Let's not forget that we need to make an informed decision about who may be the remaining Mafia member."
"Kraven : I believe we should focus on Michael. His attempts to shift blame onto me seem to be a tactic to protect himself. Let's closely examine his behavior and statements before making our decision. It's crucial we identify the remaining Mafia member correctly."
"Andrei : I believe we should focus our suspicions on Michael. His attempts to redirect blame away from himself are concerning, and his eagerness to accuse others feels like a strategic move to deflect attention. Let's carefully evaluate his behavior and actions as we decide on our next steps."
"Kraven : I believe we should vote to eliminate Michael. His attempts to divert attention and quick accusations raise red flags. We need to ensure we're making the right decision as we move forward, and I feel he may be hiding his true intentions."
"Larisa : I believe we should focus on evaluating Kraven's behavior. While Michael has been a target for suspicion, Kraven's eagerness to eliminate him may indicate a deflection tactic. Let's analyze their interactions closely before making a decision."
"Michael : I think we should closely observe Kraven. His strong push to eliminate me seems like a tactic to redirect attention from himself. We need to evaluate all players carefully before making a decision, and I urge everyone to consider whether Kraven is trying to manipulate the narrative."
"Andrei : I believe we should vote to eliminate Michael. His consistent attempts to deflect blame and manipulate our focus raise significant concerns. We need to take decisive action to ensure the safety of the remaining Citizens."
"Michael : I believe we should vote to eliminate Andrei. His consistent accusations and attempts to rally the group against me seem like attempts to deflect attention from himself. Let's not fall into the trap of quick judgments and ensure we're making the right decision."

Let's not make a hasty decision that could lead us to eliminate an innocent player."
