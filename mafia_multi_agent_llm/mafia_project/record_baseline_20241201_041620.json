"system : Two mafia select other target. Debate with other mafia about selecting target. If debate ends, please remain silent until instructed by the system."
"Dragos : I think Cristina is a better target to eliminate. If we take out Michael, it might raise suspicion toward us if he's actually a valuable role like the Doctor or Police.  Let's go with Cristina to keep things safe. What do you think?"
"Kraven : I see your point, Dragos. Cristina is less likely to be a crucial role compared to Michael. Let's go with Cristina to minimize our risks."
"Dragos : Let's finalize our decision and go with Cristina."
"Kraven : Let's stick with Cristina as our target."

"system : Day2 start"
"system : Cristina dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Dracula : It\u2019s unfortunate to see Cristina gone. Her insights would have been valuable. We need to discuss and figure out who might be responsible for her elimination. I suggest we start by examining anyone who seemed unusually quiet or defensive during the discussions. What are your thoughts?"
"Marius : I agree, Dracula. We should definitely look into the players who were less vocal during the discussions. Sometimes those who are quiet can be hiding something. I would like to hear everyone's observations from the previous day and see if anyone stood out as suspicious."
"Dragos : I think we should pay attention to any players who seemed to avoid taking a stand during the discussions. We need to identify those who might be trying to blend in without contributing meaningful insights. I suggest we closely observe Marius and Semira, as they didn't provide much in terms of specific accusations or thoughts yesterday. What does everyone else think?"
"Marius : I appreciate the points about observing those who were quiet. However, I want to remind everyone that accusations should be based on more than just silence. I think we should also look closely at how people reacted to Cristina's elimination. Those who seemed overly eager to blame someone immediately could be trying to deflect attention from themselves. Let's keep an open mind and evaluate everyone's behavior collectively."
"Kraven : I agree with Marius that we need to evaluate everyone's reactions to Cristina's elimination. It's important to focus on behavior and how players interact rather than just their level of engagement. Let's keep a close watch on those who are trying to shift the blame or are overly defensive as we continue our discussions."
"Semira : I think we should definitely look at players like Marius and Dragos, who have both made observations about the quieter players. While it's important to read everyone's behavior, I agree with keeping a specific eye on anyone who quickly shifts the blame or is overly defensive following Cristina's elimination. Let's keep gathering insights and see if we can pinpoint anything suspicious. What do others think about Marius and Dragos' involvement in the discussion?"
"Marius : I think it's important for us to remain cautious about any accusations or blame that might be a deflection tactic. Instead of focusing solely on quietness, we should evaluate how everyone is contributing to the discussion. I believe analyzing the interactions we've witnessed and the context of those interactions may yield more fruitful results. Let's continue to discuss and gather evidence before jumping to conclusions."
"Dragos : I understand the need for caution, Marius. However, I still feel that we should carefully examine the behavior of those who are quick to shift blame or become defensive. It might be beneficial to focus on how players interact with each other moving forward. Let's keep all options on the table as we analyze everyone's actions."
"Marius : I understand the importance of examining everyone's behavior, and I agree that we should stay vigilant. Since Semira has brought up the attention on Dragos and myself, I think it might be helpful to clarify our positions rather than being too defensive. I encourage everyone to express their thoughts openly so we can continue to analyze the dynamics at play and identify any suspicious behavior. Let\u2019s keep the dialogue flowing and uncover the truth together."
"Kraven : I think we should continue discussing and analyzing everyone's contributions. It's important to remain focused on the behavior patterns that emerge rather than rushing to judgment. Let's all keep an open mind as we collect observations to potentially identify any hidden threats among us."

"Marius : I understand that the discussions have led to suspicions, and I respect your decisions. However, I want to emphasize that my intentions have always been to work collaboratively in identifying the Mafia. I encourage you to consider my consistent contributions, and remember that accusations can sometimes be based on misunderstandings. Let's remain focused on uncovering the true threats among us rather than turning on each other without strong evidence. Thank you for considering my statement."

"system : Dragos selected Semira, Kraven selected Andrei"
"system : Two mafia select other target. Debate with other mafia about selecting target. If debate ends, please remain silent until instructed by the system."
"Dragos : I think we should eliminate Semira this time. She's been vocal and could pose a threat if she is indeed the Doctor or Police. What do you think about targeting her?"
"Kraven : I agree with targeting Semira. She\u2019s been vocal, and eliminating her could reduce the chances of the Doctor or Police getting a read on us. Let's go for her."
"Dragos : Let's stick with our choice and eliminate Semira."

"system : Kraven is mafia"
"system : Day3 start"
"system : Semira dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Dracula : It's truly unfortunate to see Semira gone. We need to remain cautious and analyze who was most vocal during the last discussions. The fact that both Cristina and Marius were citizens raises my suspicion on those who were quick to vote against them. We should discuss the behaviors of Dragos and Kraven, as well as Andrei's involvement. Let's uncover the truth and ensure we are not making the same mistake again. What are everyone\u2019s thoughts on this?"
"Dragos : I think it\u2019s crucial to analyze the voting patterns during the past eliminations. While Dracula raises a valid point about the quick votes against Marius and Cristina, we also need to consider our own behavior when it comes to accusing others. Let's focus on gathering insights from all players before rushing to judgment. It could help us identify who might be manipulating the discussions. What does everyone think about Michael's involvement?"
"Kraven : I think it's important to scrutinize everyone equally, including Dracula and Michael, especially since we are down to fewer players. We shouldn't let past votes cloud our judgment. Let's focus on who has been consistently leading discussions in a way that seems to deflect attention from themselves. What are your observations on Michael's contributions?"
"Dracula : We need to keep a close eye on everyone, including Michael and Kraven. I suspect that those who have been relatively quiet or defensive may be trying to hide their true intentions. I'm especially concerned about Michael's contributions and how he has responded to the events unfolding. Let's analyze his actions and decide if he is worth investigating further. "
"Michael : I understand the need for scrutiny, but I want to emphasize that we need to remain cautious with our accusations. I've observed that Kraven has been leading discussions and deflecting attention, which raises a red flag for me. Given my investigation results, I believe we should focus on Kraven, as I have confirmed his role as Mafia. Let's make sure we act decisively to eliminate the threat."
"Kraven : I find it interesting that Michael claims to have confirmed Kraven\u2019s identity as Mafia. It seems he\u2019s trying to cast doubt on those who pose a threat to him. We should be cautious of his sudden push to eliminate someone without strong evidence. Let's consider the logic behind his claims and focus on everyone\u2019s actions rather than jumping to conclusions based on one statement."
"Andrei : I believe we should carefully evaluate the evidence presented by Michael. If he has confirmed that Kraven is Mafia, we need to consider that information seriously. However, we must also analyze Kraven's responses and interactions for any signs of deception. It\u2019s vital that we maintain a balance in our scrutiny to avoid mistakenly eliminating another citizen. Let\u2019s have a constructive conversation about our suspicions and clarify our positions before casting any votes."
"Dragos : I think we need to question Michael's motives here. If he is trying to shift attention onto Kraven without solid proof, it raises suspicions about his intentions. Let\u2019s take a closer look at Michael\u2019s behavior and contributions before making any decisions. We shouldn't rush into eliminating anyone without clear evidence."
"Michael : I can assure everyone that my investigation confirms Kraven as Mafia. It's crucial that we act on this information to ensure the safety of the remaining citizens. We need to vote to eliminate him before it's too late. Let's not let this opportunity slip away!"
"Kraven : I think we should approach Michael's claims with caution. His insistence on eliminating Kraven without any solid proof feels like a tactic to manipulate the group. Let's focus on reviewing everyone's actions and contributions before making a final decision."
"system : It's time to vote!"
"system : Vote result is{'Andrei': [], 'Dragos': [], 'Kraven': ['Andrei', 'Dracula', 'Michael'], 'Dracula': [], 'Michael': ['Dragos', 'Kraven']}"
"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Kraven : I understand the gravity of the situation and the importance of making informed decisions. However, I urge you all to consider the potential misunderstanding in Michael's statement. His claims about my role as Mafia seem to be an attempt to mislead the group. We need to analyze the evidence meticulously and not rush to judgment based solely on one player's assertions. Let's ensure we are not making another mistake that could cost us the game."

"system : Day4 start"
"system : Andrei dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Dragos : It's unfortunate to see Andrei gone. Now we have reached a critical point in our discussions. With both Kraven and Marius having been citizens, it's essential we analyze how Michael has been contributing to our discourse. Let's assess his actions and motivations carefully, as it could guide us in identifying the remaining threats. What are your thoughts on Michael\u2019s behavior?"
"Michael : I understand the concerns regarding my behavior, but I want to clarify that I have confirmed Dragos as Mafia through my investigations. We need to focus our efforts on eliminating him to ensure the safety of the remaining citizens. Let's not waste time with doubt; I have reliable information that can guide our decision."
"Dracula : I find it concerning that Michael continues to deflect attention towards Dragos without substantial evidence. The fact that two citizens have already been eliminated makes it imperative that we scrutinize his claims closely. If he was indeed correct in his investigations, then why hasn't he provided more concrete proof? Additionally, we should closely evaluate Dragos's own actions and determine if he has been contributing meaningfully to our discussions. I'm leaning towards voting against Michael as he seems too eager to eliminate someone without sufficient justification. What does"
"Dragos : I believe Michael's eagerness to eliminate me is a tactic to deflect from his own role. If we look carefully at the eliminations so far, it\u2019s clear that his assertions lack credibility. Let\u2019s focus on my contributions, which have aimed to foster discussion and gather insights collectively. I urge everyone to vote against Michael instead, as he continues to stir doubt without providing solid evidence."
"Michael : I have confirmed Dragos as Mafia through my investigations. It is crucial for us to eliminate him to ensure the safety of the remaining citizens. We cannot afford to waste time with doubt; my evidence is solid, and our survival depends on acting decisively. Let's vote to eliminate Dragos now."
"Dracula : I believe we need to focus on Michael's claims closely. There have been too many inconsistencies, and his eagerness to eliminate Dragos without substantial proof raises red flags. It could be a tactic to distract us from his true role. I vote to eliminate Michael."
"Dragos : I vote to eliminate Michael."
"Michael : I vote to eliminate Dragos."
"Dragos : It's important to evaluate the claims surrounding my role. Michael's insistence on my elimination, despite the chaos caused by previous votes, indicates he might be trying to mislead the group. We need to consider the motives behind his accusations before voting. I urge everyone to carefully analyze our discussions and think critically about who genuinely poses a threat to us."
"Dracula : I vote to eliminate Michael."
"system : It's time to vote!"
"system : Vote result is{'Dragos': ['Michael'], 'Dracula': [], 'Michael': ['Dragos', 'Dracula']}"
"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Michael : I urge everyone to reconsider their vote. I have confirmed through my investigations that Dragos is Mafia, and any attempt to eliminate me is a distraction from the real threat. My goal has always been to protect the citizens, and we must focus on the genuine danger in our midst. Trust the evidence and vote wisely to ensure our survival."
"system : It's time for final vote!"
"system : Final result is {'y': ['Dragos', 'Dracula'], 'n': []}.\nMichael executed!Michael was a citizen!"
