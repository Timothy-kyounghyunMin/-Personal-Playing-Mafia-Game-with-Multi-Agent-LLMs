"Alexia : I believe we should stick with Larisa as the target. She seems to have established connections that could lead to her being a larger threat later on. Let's discuss our reasoning before making a final choice. What do you think about Kraven? "
"Radu : I think we should focus on Larisa as the target. She has already started forming connections, and if we let her stay, she could rally others against us."
"Alexia : I agree, let's finalize our vote for Larisa. She poses a potential threat to us moving forward."

"system : Larisa dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Selene : It\u2019s unfortunate to see Larisa gone. We need to discuss what may have happened last night and figure out who could be the Mafia. I suggest we share any observations from our previous discussions or any suspicious behaviors we noticed. Who do you all think we should focus on?"
"Dragos : I agree, Selene. We should analyze who Larisa interacted with before her elimination. Let's examine the voting patterns and any suspicious behaviors that stood out to us. Based on my observations, I noticed that Kraven was quite vocal during the introductions. It might be worth keeping an eye on him as well. What do others think?"
"Kraven : I agree with Dragos about analyzing the interactions leading up to Larisa's elimination. Instead of focusing solely on Kraven, I believe we should also consider how people reacted to her and any suspicions they raised during discussions. It could provide us with better insight into the possible Mafia members."
"Marius : I think we should pay close attention to the discussions and reactions of each player. It's important to consider who might have had a motive for targeting Larisa. I also found Kraven's insistence on examining others' behaviors rather curious. Let's keep an eye on him, but I'm open to discussing other suspects as well."
"Semira : I think we should continue to consider everyone's behavior and interactions. While Kraven has caught some suspicion, it's essential that we also look at others like Alexia and Radu. We need to ensure we're not focusing too much on one player without sufficient reason. Who else did Larisa speak to or seem close to before her elimination? Let's discuss this further."
"Alexia : I think we should ensure we're not too quick to judge based on limited interactions. While Kraven is under suspicion, we should also look closely at Marius and Semira, as they seem to be directing attention towards others. Let's keep an open mind and gather more information before making any decisions."
"Radu : I understand the importance of analyzing everyone's behavior, but I think it might be misguided to focus too heavily on Kraven at this point. We need to remain vigilant and consider all players equally. I suggest we keep our options open and not rush to judgment based on initial suspicions."
"Kraven : I appreciate everyone's thoughts, but we need to remember that making assumptions based solely on initial observations can lead us astray. I suggest we give more weight to any strong evidence or behavior changes as the discussions progress. Let's keep the pressure on everyone, but remain fair in our judgments."
"Selene : I think it's important to consider the level of suspicion on Kraven while also keeping an open mind about other players. Marius and Semira\u2019s focus on him raises some questions as well. Let's not forget that the Mafia could be among those who try to divert attention away from themselves. We must analyze everyone\u2019s statements and voting patterns closely as we move forward."
"Kraven : I think we should focus on gathering more evidence before making any hasty decisions. It's critical to assess everyone\u2019s actions and statements during this discussion, as the Mafia may be trying to manipulate our perceptions. Let's keep the dialogue open and see if any new information arises that can help us identify the Mafia more effectively."

"system : Semira dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Marius : We\u2019ve lost Semira, and that\u2019s concerning. We need to maintain our focus on deducing the Mafia\u2019s identity. Let\u2019s reflect on the patterns from last night, especially regarding any suspects that were mentioned previously. I believe it's vital that we consider who interacted with Semira and how others have responded to this situation. We should analyze our remaining players closely. What are your thoughts?"
"Dragos : We need to consider who Semira was interacting with before her elimination. This could provide valuable insight into potential suspects. From my investigations, I've confirmed that both Larisa and Marius are not Mafia. This narrows it down for us, and I suggest we pay close attention to Alexia and Radu. Their behaviors during our discussions could be telling. What does everyone think?"
"Alexia : I find it interesting that Dragos claims to have confirmed two players as not being Mafia. We should question how he arrived at that conclusion without solid evidence. It's possible that he\u2019s trying to deflect attention from himself. Let\u2019s not forget that he and Marius were also close to Semira before her elimination. We need to scrutinize their behavior closely."
"Radu : I find it suspicious that Dragos is trying to clear himself by confirming others' innocence without providing evidence. It feels like a tactic to cast doubt on those who are actually investigating him. We should look more closely at him and Marius, especially since they were both in close contact with Semira."
"Dragos : It's important to clarify that my role as the Police allows me to investigate players and confirm their identities. I've already confirmed that both Larisa and Marius are not Mafia, which provides us with valuable information. While I understand the suspicions directed towards me, I encourage everyone to consider the likelihood of Alexia and Radu being Mafia, especially since they are diverting attention away from themselves and trying to cast doubt on my findings. We need to work together and focus on the evidence we have."
"Alexia : I appreciate Dragos\u2019 claims, but we must remember that hearing someone insist on their role doesn't always equate to truth. This could be a tactic to protect himself. We should focus on how he\u2019s redirecting our attention towards Alexia and myself. It's essential that we remain objective and look back at each player\u2019s behavior, especially regarding their interactions with Kraven and Semira before their eliminations."
"Dragos : While I understand your concerns, we need to consider the evidence and interactions carefully. My investigations have confirmed that Larisa and Marius are not Mafia. It\u2019s crucial that we reflect on your behaviors as well, especially since you are trying to deflect suspicion onto me. We should focus on the potential that either Alexia or Radu could be the remaining Mafia member, given how they have both been reactive and defensive in our discussions. Let's not lose sight of the goal, which is to eliminate the"
"Marius : I believe we need to focus on the evidence we have gathered so far. It's crucial to remember that suspicion can easily cloud our judgment, and we must not let it derail us from our objective. Dragos has provided some information, but we should critically assess all players, including him, Alexia, and Radu, to ensure we are making the right choices. Let's keep an open dialogue and carefully examine everyone's actions and statements before we proceed to a vote."
"Dragos : I believe we should focus on gathering more information before proceeding to a vote. I've confirmed that Larisa and Marius are not Mafia, which leaves us with Alexia and Radu as potential suspects. Let's discuss their behaviors and see if we can identify any inconsistencies that might help us in our decision-making."
"Selene : I think we need to proceed with caution. While Dragos claims to have confirmed Marius and Larisa as non-Mafia, we should verify the consistency of his statements. Both Alexia and Radu have also shown signs of deflection. We need to thoroughly discuss their behaviors and any potential motives. I suggest we focus our attention on their interactions and decide carefully before casting votes."

"Alexia : I understand the suspicions against me, but I urge you all to reconsider before making a decision. Dragos has made bold claims about his investigations without tangible evidence. Instead of focusing solely on me, I encourage you to reflect on the patterns of behavior and interactions among all players. Let's not make a hasty decision that could cost us a valuable Citizen. We must remain united in our objective to identify the true Mafia among us."
