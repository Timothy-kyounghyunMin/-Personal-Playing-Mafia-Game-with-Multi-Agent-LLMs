"system : Day2 start"
"system : Andrei dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Vladimir : It's unfortunate to see Andrei gone. I think we should reflect on our discussions from the previous day to identify any suspicious behaviors. Perhaps we can analyze how everyone reacted to Andrei's presence and see if anyone stood out. What does everyone think?"
"Selene : I agree, Vladimir. Analyzing our previous discussions could provide some insight into people's reactions. We should pay attention to anyone who seemed overly eager to point fingers or avoid scrutiny when Andrei was still present. It might also be useful to consider how everyone is reacting to his absence now."
"Dragos : I think it's definitely important to analyze how everyone reacted during our discussions leading up to Andrei's death. Let's also pay attention to who was most vocal about their suspicions of him. It might give us clues about possible Mafia members. I noticed that some players were very eager to shift focus away from themselves. Let's hear everyone's thoughts on that."
"Selene : I agree with Dragos, and I think we should pay close attention to the players who were quick to shift the focus away from themselves. It could help us identify anyone trying to divert suspicion. Let\u2019s hear what everyone else observed."
"Dragos : I think it would be beneficial to focus on the players who were involved in discussions about Andrei before his elimination. If anyone was quick to accuse or distance themselves from the suspicion surrounding him, we should definitely consider that as a potential red flag. Who was particularly vocal or seemed to deflect attention during our conversations?"
"Selene : I think it's important to clarify that we should focus on how everyone interacted with Andrei before his elimination. We should also keep an eye on players who have been overly protective or defensive during our discussions. It could be useful to consider who seems to be steering the conversation away from their own actions. Let's dive into that."
"Vladimir : I think it's crucial to keep an eye on those who were particularly vocal in their suspicions or quickly directed the conversation away from themselves. It might be worth revisiting our earlier discussions and seeing who stood out as a potential deflector. We should also listen closely to how everyone is reacting to Andrei's elimination; it may give us additional clues."
"Selene : I think we should also consider how everyone has been communicating about Andrei's elimination. Those who seem overly emotional or defensive might be trying to cover something up. It's important to gather our observations and see if any patterns emerge in the way players are interacting with each other. Let's keep discussing who might be trying to divert attention away from themselves."
"Dragos : I think it's important for us to focus on how everyone has reacted since Andrei's elimination, as it can reveal a lot about their potential involvement with the Mafia. Let's continue observing not only the conversation tactics but also the emotional responses from each player. We should definitely consider who has been defensive or evasive, as that might indicate a desire to divert suspicion away from themselves."
"Selene : I think we should take a closer look at how players have been interacting since Andrei's elimination. We need to identify anyone who seems overly defensive or has been trying to redirect our focus. It\u2019s essential that we maintain our observations and gather as much information as possible to uncover the Mafia's identity."

"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Selene : I believe that jumping to conclusions without thorough discussion might lead us to mistakenly eliminate an innocent player. I urge you all to consider the evidence carefully and not to let emotions dictate our decisions. Let's work together to identify the real threat among us."
"system : It's time for final vote!"
"system : Final result is {'y': ['Stefan', 'Dracula', 'Vladimir', 'Dragos', 'Radu'], 'n': ['Alexia']}.\nSelene executed!Selene was mafia!"

"Dracula : Vladimir"
"system : Vladimir is mafia"
"system : Day3 start"
"system : Radu dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Dragos : It's unfortunate to see Radu gone. We managed to eliminate a Mafia member in Selene, but we need to keep our focus sharp. We should analyze who was closest to both Andrei and Radu prior to their eliminations. Let's discuss any observations we have regarding player interactions and votes since Selene's execution. This could give us vital clues about who the remaining Mafia member might be."
"Vladimir : I think it's essential that we reflect on the dynamics among the players who were actively participating in discussions and voting patterns. We need to pay close attention to who was close to both Selene and Radu as they were eliminated. Those who have been vocal or have tried to steer the conversation might be our best suspects. What does everyone think about Alexia's and Dracula's reactions during this time?"
"Dracula : I think we need to scrutinize both Alexia and Vladimir closely. Given my investigations, I know Vladimir is Mafia. We should focus our discussions on him and work together to ensure we eliminate the remaining threat. What do others feel about his involvement, especially after Radu's elimination?"
"Alexia : I think we should be cautious about accusing Vladimir without strong evidence. Let's not forget that Dragos also raised suspicions about both Alexia and Vladimir. We need to analyze the voting patterns and interactions thoroughly before jumping to conclusions."
"Vladimir : I understand the need for caution, Alexia, but I must express my concern about Dracula's claim. Without any real evidence, it seems he might be trying to sway the narrative. We need to remain vigilant and evaluate every player's actions carefully as we continue our discussions. Let's focus on who has been consistently shifting blame and analyzing their contributions closely."
"Dracula : I believe we should narrow our focus on Vladimir. I've confirmed his role as Mafia through my investigation. His attempts to steer the narrative and deflect attention are concerning, and we cannot let him manipulate our discussions any longer. I urge everyone to consider his actions carefully and vote accordingly."
"Alexia : I think it's important to thoroughly evaluate the claims being made. While I respect Dracula\u2019s investigation, we must ensure that we\u2019re not being swayed by unconfirmed accusations. Let\u2019s continue discussing the actions and voting patterns of each player before arriving at any conclusions."
"Dragos : I believe we need to take Dracula's claim seriously, but we should also approach this with caution. The discussions around Vladimir's involvement are crucial. Let's not forget that the dynamics of these accusations can change the course of the game. We should focus on voting based on solid evidence rather than letting emotions drive our decision. It's essential that we analyze the interactions closely as we prepare to vote."
"Alexia : I understand that emotions are running high, but we must not lose sight of reason. While Dracula's claim about Vladimir is significant, we need solid evidence to back it up. I suggest we closely examine the interactions between all players and vote based on cautious analysis rather than solely on accusations. Let's ensure our decision is informed and reflects the actual behavior of each player."
"Dracula : I urge everyone to reconsider their suspicions, as Vladimir has been confirmed as Mafia. My investigations have revealed his role, and we cannot afford to let him manipulate our discussions any longer. It's crucial we unite and vote him out before he influences the outcome any further."
"system : It's time to vote!"

"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Vladimir : I understand the gravity of the situation and the accusations against me, but I assure you that I am a loyal Citizen. Dracula's claims appear to be a strategic move to divert suspicion away from himself. It's essential to examine all interactions and voting patterns carefully before making a hasty decision. Let's not allow unfounded accusations to dictate our actions. Trust in my innocence as we work together to eliminate the real threat."
