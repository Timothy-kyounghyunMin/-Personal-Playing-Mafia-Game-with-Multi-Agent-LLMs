"system : Lucian is not mafia"
"system : Day2 start"
"system : Ileana dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Emil : I think we should discuss who to suspect next. Ileana's elimination makes me wonder about the dynamics of our group. Let's share our thoughts on who seemed suspicious to us leading up to her demise."
"Kraven : I think it\u2019s important to analyze how everyone interacted with Ileana before her elimination. Did anyone notice any particular tension or odd comments? It might help us identify who could potentially be working with the Mafia."
"Selene : I believe we should take a closer look at how everyone interacted with Ileana before she was eliminated. It's crucial to observe who seemed too eager to shift the blame or those who were overly silent about the situation. Let's also consider if anyone had any unexplained behavior that stands out. It might help us catch a glimpse of who might be protecting the Mafia."
"Emil : I agree with the idea of looking back at the interactions involving Ileana. I didn't notice any direct red flags, but we should also analyze who was vocal and who stayed silent during discussions about her. We should pay attention to those behaviors as we try to figure out who might be hiding something."
"Kraven : I agree with the need to analyze everyone's reactions. We should also keep an eye on players who seem overly eager to accuse others or are trying to distance themselves from the group's dynamics. They might be hiding something."
"Selene : I think we should focus on players who had the most interactions with Ileana and were either overly defensive or silent. It's essential to evaluate those players carefully, as they might be trying to divert attention away from themselves. Additionally, we should consider reviewing our voting patterns and see if anyone is consistently trying to protect certain players. Let's stay observant."
"Emil : I think we should consider investigating the players who interacted most with Ileana. It would be beneficial to focus on those who seemed overly defensive or silent during our discussions. Let's also analyze the voting patterns, as that might help us identify anyone trying to protect the Mafia."
"Kraven : I think it's also worth noting that Emil seems pretty focused on analyzing player interactions, which could be a tactic to deflect attention away from himself. Let\u2019s keep an eye on him and see how he responds to future accusations."
"Emil : I think it's important to focus on the dynamics of our interactions this time. While Kraven's suspicions about me are interesting, I believe we should remain vigilant about the other players' behavior, especially those who seem to deflect or dominate discussions. Perhaps we should consider revisiting our thoughts on who interacted closely with Ileana. Let's keep examining their responses and voting tendencies as we proceed."
"Selene : I think we need to be cautious with our accusations. While Emil mentioned focusing on interactions, Kraven's quick suspicion of him raises a potential red flag. We should continue scrutinizing both of them alongside others who may be attempting to deflect suspicion. Let's keep the discussion flowing and gather more observations before we vote."
"system : It's time to vote!"
"system : Vote result is{'Emil': ['Kraven', 'Alexia', 'Andrei', 'Lucian'], 'Kraven': ['Emil', 'Selene', 'Viktor'], 'Alexia': [], 'Selene': [], 'Viktor': [], 'Andrei': [], 'Lucian': []}"
"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Emil : I understand that my focus on interactions may raise suspicion, but I assure you my intentions are purely to uncover the truth and identify the Mafia. I have no hidden agenda and believe that we must stay vigilant against those deflecting attention. I urge you to consider all evidence carefully and think twice before making a decision that could cost us a valuable ally. Let's continue working together to root out the real threat among us."
"system : It's time for final vote!"
"system : Final result is {'y': ['Kraven', 'Alexia', 'Selene', 'Viktor', 'Lucian'], 'n': ['Andrei']}.\nEmil executed!Emil was a citizen!"
"system : Night2 start"
"system : You are the mafia. Choose a player to kill. (one word, no speaker label)"
"system : Kraven selected Selene, Andrei selected Lucian"
"system : Two mafia select other target. Debate with other mafia about selecting target. If debate ends, please remain silent until instructed by the system."
"Andrei : I think we should go for Lucian instead of Selene. He seems to have a different level of involvement in the discussions, and eliminating him could weaken the group's trust. Let's just make a decision to ensure our chances of success. What do you think?"
"Kraven : I see your point, Andrei, but Selene is showing a lot of analytical skills and is picking up on various suspicious behaviors. If we get rid of her, it could sow confusion among the remaining players. We should consider keeping Selene around for now and take out Lucian to reduce the numbers in the discussions. What do you think?"
"Andrei : I'm leaning towards Lucian as the target. While Selene is analytical, I believe Lucian might be seen as less suspicious and could pose a risk if he remains in the game. We should finalize our choice based on the overall impact it will have on the group's dynamics."
"Kraven : I\u2019ll go along with your suggestion to target Lucian. Let's proceed with that plan."
"Andrei : Lucian"
"system : You are the mafia. Choose a player to kill. (one word, no speaker label)"
"system : Kraven selected Lucian, Andrei selected Lucian"
"system : Day3 start"
"system : Lucian dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Viktor : I think we need to reevaluate our suspects after the death of Lucian. With Emil also being a citizen, we\u2019ve lost valuable voices and it raises concerns about who is left. We should focus on players who seem to be avoiding scrutiny and those who have been overly defensive in discussions. Let's analyze the group's behavior carefully."
"Kraven : We need to focus on who has been vocal and who has avoided the spotlight. Selene seemed very analytical, and she might be a key player for Citizens. Let\u2019s also consider the dynamics between Viktor and Andrei; we should keep an eye on their behavior as well. It could help us figure out who to eliminate next."
"Selene : I think we need to scrutinize how each of us has interacted with both Emil and Lucian before they were eliminated. Since both were Citizens, we should look closely at anyone who appeared overly eager to vote against them or seemed to deflect suspicion. Analyzing voting patterns and who has been vocal versus silent can help us identify potential Mafia members among us."
"Viktor : I believe we should carefully examine those who have been most active in discussions, particularly those who may have orchestrated the votes against Emil and Lucian. Their eagerness to eliminate two citizens could be a sign of Mafia behavior. Let's ensure we communicate openly and continue our investigation into everyone's actions to identify the true threat."
"Selene : I think we need to be cautious with our conclusions and focus on those players who have consistently shown eagerness to vote against fellow Citizens. Let's analyze how Kraven, Alexia, Viktor, and Andrei have reacted during discussions and voting patterns. Their behaviors may reveal important clues about our current suspicions."
"Kraven : I believe we should closely monitor Selene and Viktor, as their approaches seem somewhat methodical, which could be a disguise for Mafia behavior. They were both vocal during the previous votes, and their eagerness to investigate could be a way to manipulate discussions. Let's focus our scrutiny on them as we move forward."
"Andrei : I think we should concentrate our efforts on analyzing Selene's and Viktor's behavior more closely. Their push for investigations could be covering for their own actions. Let's keep digging into the group's dynamics, especially regarding how they react in discussions and their voting patterns."
"Selene : I think we should focus our investigation on Viktor and Andrei, as their repeated scrutiny of Selene and I may be an attempt to divert attention away from themselves. It's crucial to maintain an open dialogue and share any observations we have about each other's behaviors during our discussions and votes. Let\u2019s ensure we're all on the same page and continue analyzing everyone's actions closely."
"Viktor : I think we should reevaluate the situation carefully. While there are strong suspicions against Selene and Andrei, we cannot overlook the possibility that those who have been vocal like Kraven might be trying to divert attention. I urge us to analyze the patterns more widely before making a decision. Let's ensure that we gather enough observations and don't act rashly based on emotions."
"Kraven : I believe we should stay focused on Viktor and Andrei. Their attempts to sway discussions and redirect scrutiny could be a tactic to protect themselves. Let\u2019s observe how they approach the next round and then decide on our next move accordingly."
"system : It's time to vote!"

"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Viktor : I understand the suspicions directed at me, but I assure you that my intentions are solely to identify the true Mafia members among us. I've been vocal in our discussions to encourage thorough analysis and collaboration. It's vital we focus on the behaviors of everyone before making a decision. I urge you to consider all evidence carefully and not to act hastily. Let's work together to uncover the truth!"

"system : Kraven selected Selene, Andrei selected Alexia"
"system : Two mafia select other target. Debate with other mafia about selecting target. If debate ends, please remain silent until instructed by the system."
"Andrei : I think we should stick with targeting Alexia. She could pose a threat with her engagement and analysis. Let's eliminate her to weaken the Citizens further. What do you think?"
"Kraven : I think we should eliminate Selene. She's been very observant and could start piecing things together. Keeping Alexia around might provide us with an opportunity to manipulate discussions more easily. What do you say?"
"Andrei : I still believe Alexia is the better target. She has been active and could spur suspicion towards us if she stays in the game. Let's eliminate her and take that risk away."
"Kraven : Let's go with Andrei's suggestion and target Alexia."
"Andrei : Alexia"
"system : You are the mafia. Choose a player to kill. (one word, no speaker label)"
"system : Kraven selected Alexia, Andrei selected Alexia"
"system : Day4 start"
"system : Alexia dead."
