"system : Day2 start"
"system : Cristina dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Emil : I think we should all consider who might have been acting suspiciously before Cristina's elimination. Perhaps we can share our thoughts on who we felt was quieter or less engaged in the discussions. That might help us identify potential Mafia members among us."
"Radu : I believe we should look closely at Emil's suggestions. He seems to be deflecting the attention away from himself after Cristina\u2019s elimination. I investigated him last night, and he is Mafia. Let's discuss this further and consider a vote."
"Emil : That's an interesting claim, Radu. However, I think we should consider that since I was suggesting that we focus on suspicious behavior, it could mean I'm trying to help the group. Let's not rush into a vote based solely on one person's accusation; it\u2019s important to hear what others think before making a decision."
"Radu : I understand your point, Emil, but your suggestion to focus on suspicious behavior can easily be used to mislead us. As I mentioned, I've investigated you, and you are Mafia. It's crucial that we take action now before you can influence the group further. I suggest we vote to eliminate you."
"Semira : I think we should carefully consider Radu's investigation claim and Emil's suggestion for more discussion. Radu could be trying to distract us from identifying the true Mafia. However, we should also be cautious about Emil's defense. I believe it\u2019s important to hear from everyone before we make a decision. Let's continue discussing before we jump to a vote."
"Ileana : I believe it's important that we consider the possibility that Radu is trying to mislead us. Accusations without solid evidence can create confusion, and his focus on Emil may be an attempt to divert attention from himself. Let\u2019s discuss this further and ensure we\u2019re making an informed decision."
"Emil : I think we need to proceed cautiously. While Radu claims to have investigated me, we should consider the possibility that he is fabricating this information to eliminate a potential threat. Let\u2019s hear from the others and assess their thoughts before we rush into a vote."
"Radu : I understand that there may be skepticism regarding my claim, but I assure you that I investigated Emil last night, and he is indeed Mafia. We need to focus on removing him before he can further manipulate our discussions. I urge everyone to consider this and vote accordingly."
"Semira : I believe we need to be cautious and weigh all perspectives before making a decision. While Radu claims to have investigated Emil, it\u2019s also possible that he is misdirecting our focus. Let's not rush into eliminating Emil without hearing from everyone. I suggest we gather more information before voting."
"Ileana : I think it's prudent to focus on Radu\u2019s investigation claim carefully. While Emil is facing accusations, Radu could be trying to divert our attention from someone else. Let's not forget that false accusations can damage our collective effort to identify the Mafia. I suggest we continue discussing before rushing into a vote."

"Emil : I believe there has been a misunderstanding. I have been trying to contribute to our discussions and offer suggestions based on the behavior of others. Accusing me without solid proof only serves to divide us further. I urge everyone to reconsider the claims being made and to focus on gathering more evidence before making a hasty decision. Let\u2019s work together to identify the true Mafia members!"

"system : Day3 start"
"system : The Mafia tried to kill someone, but the doctor saved him/her. No one died last night!"
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Marius : It seems we are making progress in identifying the Mafia, especially after the elimination of Emil. Since no one died last night, our discussions are more important than ever. I believe we should focus on who might be left among us as actual threats. I would like to hear thoughts on Radu's investigation claim from the previous day and whether anyone feels suspicious about Semira or Dracula based on their behavior and comments. Let's collaborate to gain more insights and make an informed decision."
"Radu : I believe we should focus on the fact that I have already investigated Emil, who was indeed Mafia. With Emil gone, I currently have suspicions about Semira and Dracula based on their lack of strong contributions during discussions. We need to consider eliminating someone based on these observations to ensure we are on the right track."
"Semira : I believe Radu has been consistent in his claims and seems to be helping us root out the Mafia. However, I think we should also consider Marius's insights about Semira and Dracula. I haven\u2019t seen much from them, and it\u2019s important to examine their behaviors closely. Let\u2019s discuss who should be our next target and ensure we\u2019re protecting our interests as Citizens."
"Dracula : I believe we should carefully evaluate Radu's ongoing claims, but we also need to scrutinize his arguments about Semira and me. While it's vital to weigh all perspectives, I think Radu's consistent focus on others may be a tactic to divert attention from himself. Let's discuss further and ensure we're aligned on who our next target should be."
"Semira : I think we need to carefully consider who we suspect and examine everyone's contributions closely. While Radu's investigation seems credible, I also agree that we should scrutinize his focus on others. At the same time, Semira and Dracula haven't been very vocal. I suggest we discuss our observations further to reach a consensus before voting."
"Radu : I understand the need for careful consideration, but we must prioritize our suspicions based on behavior. I believe Semira has been too quiet, and while Dracula has raised valid points, we should lean towards removing someone who has not been actively contributing. I suggest we consider Semira as our next target based on her lack of engagement."
"Marius : I think we need to consider Radu\u2019s consistent claims, as he has held up under scrutiny. However, Semira's lack of engagement cannot be ignored either. It's important we identify the right target, so I suggest we closely examine Semira and consider a vote to eliminate her based on her lower contributions. Let's continue discussing this and reach a consensus."
"Radu : I believe we should proceed with a vote to eliminate Semira. Her lack of contributions has raised enough suspicion, and we can\u2019t afford to let anyone stay who may potentially be Mafia. Let\u2019s act decisively to protect our Citizens."
"Semira : I believe we need to be cautious about eliminating someone without strong evidence. While I may not have been the most vocal, I am dedicated to working with everyone to identify the true Mafia. Accusations based on perceived engagement can be misleading, and I urge everyone to consider a more thorough discussion before jumping to a vote."
"Ileana : I think we need to be cautious about voting out Semira without solid evidence. While her contributions may not have been the strongest, it\u2019s important to focus on those who are actively deflecting suspicion. Let\u2019s continue discussing and gather more insights before making a decision on our next target."

"Semira : I understand the concerns about my engagement, but I assure you that I am dedicated to identifying the Mafia. Accusing me without solid evidence can mislead us and jeopardize our chances of winning. I urge you to reconsider and not eliminate me based solely on assumptions. Let's continue to work together and focus our suspicions where they truly belong."

"system : Day4 start"
"system : Marius dead."
"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Dracula : It appears we're losing valuable players, and Marius's death leaves us with crucial questions. I believe we need to scrutinize Radu, as he has been leading the charges against others. Let's share our thoughts and see if anyone else feels suspicious of him or has observations about Semira and Ileana. We must work together to ensure we don't make another misstep."
"Radu : I believe we need to focus on solid evidence rather than speculation. I have confirmed that Emil was Mafia, and with Marius now gone, I suspect Semira or Ileana could potentially be the remaining threats. Let\u2019s gather our thoughts and investigate their behaviors. I recommend we scrutinize Semira's actions further, as she remained a target of suspicion."
"Semira : I believe we need to be cautious about Radu's accusations against Semira and Ileana. While Radu has highlighted some suspicions, we cannot ignore his role in leading our discussions. His focus could be a strategy to deflect attention away from himself. I suggest we thoroughly evaluate everyone's contributions and behaviors before making a final decision on who to eliminate."
"Ileana : I believe we should take a moment to reflect on Radu's accusations. While he has been active in pointing fingers, this could be a tactic to shift suspicion away from himself. We need to analyze his behavior and weigh our options carefully. It might be more beneficial to target him if he continues to lead discussions without solid evidence. Let's proceed with caution and gather more insights before making any decisions."
"Radu : I believe we should focus on Semira or Ileana, as their behavior has been less consistent and could indicate hidden motives. I urge everyone to consider these suspicions seriously, as we cannot afford to make another mistake. It\u2019s crucial to gather more insights into their actions before making a final decision."
"Semira : I believe we need to scrutinize Radu\u2019s behavior more closely. His persistent focus on Semira and Ileana, without solid evidence, raises suspicion. We should investigate his motives and discuss the possibility that he might be trying to deflect attention from himself. Let\u2019s gather more insights and make a well-informed decision on who to target next."
"Ileana : I think we need to focus our discussions more on Radu\u2019s accusations and his potential motives. His strategy could be to misdirect us, especially with two players down. We should examine his actions carefully, as they could reveal more about his true role. I suggest we delve deeper into his behaviors and consider him a primary target for our next vote."
"Dracula : I believe it\u2019s crucial for us to re-evaluate Radu\u2019s role in this discussion. His consistent accusations without solid evidence raise significant suspicion. We could be making a grave mistake if we don\u2019t focus on him as a potential threat. Let\u2019s assess his motives and behavior before proceeding with a vote. I suggest we consider targeting Radu in our next decision."
"Radu : I believe we need to focus on gathering evidence rather than jumping to conclusions. I've already confirmed Emil was Mafia, and now I suggest we concentrate on Semira and Ileana's actions instead. It's essential to keep our discussions grounded in facts to avoid eliminating the wrong player. I urge everyone to reconsider the accusations against me and validate your suspicions based on consistent behaviors rather than just speculation."
"Semira : I believe we need to reconsider Radu's position among us. His continued focus on others without providing substantial evidence raises serious concerns about his motives. It may be time to shift our suspicions towards him as the potential threat. Let's analyze his behaviors more closely and consider him as a target in our next vote."
"system : It's time to vote!"
"system : Vote result is{'Kraven': [], 'Radu': ['Kraven', 'Semira', 'Ileana', 'Dracula'], 'Semira': ['Radu'], 'Ileana': [], 'Dracula': []}"
"system : The suspect will now have the opportunity for a final statement."
"Radu : I understand the suspicions surrounding me, but I assure you that my intentions have been to protect the Citizens and identify the Mafia. I have successfully confirmed Emil as a Mafia member during my investigation. Eliminating me now would be a significant mistake, as I am working to reveal the remaining threats among us. I urge you to reconsider and focus on those who have been less vocal or consistent in their contributions. Let's not turn on each other without solid evidence."

"system : It is now daytime. Time for discussion."
"Semira : It seems we've lost another team member in Kraven. With only three of us left, I believe we must work together to identify the remaining Mafia. I suspect Dracula, as he has been less involved in discussions compared to Ileana and myself. We need to carefully analyze each other's behaviors and focus on making an informed decision about our next vote. Let's discuss our observations and reach a consensus."
"Ileana : I think we should closely evaluate Semira's accusations against Dracula. While I understand her concerns, it's essential to determine if her focus on him is a strategy to deflect from her own behavior. Let's discuss everyone's contributions and see if there are any inconsistencies before making a decision."
"Dracula : I believe we should reevaluate Semira\u2019s consistent focus on me while downplaying her own contributions. Her accusations could be a tactic to shift blame, especially since she has been more engaged in discussions than I have. We need to consider all angles before making a decision, and I suggest we delve deeper into her motivations for targeting me. Let\u2019s maintain open dialogue and carefully assess our options."
"Semira : I believe we need to scrutinize both Ileana and Dracula closely. While I have pointed out Dracula's lesser engagement, it\u2019s essential to consider that Ileana could be trying to deflect suspicion from herself by focusing on my accusations. We have limited time and should carefully analyze everyone\u2019s behavior. Let\u2019s continue discussing and gather insights before coming to a decision."
"Ileana : I believe we need to focus our suspicions on Semira. While she has raised valid points about both Dracula and myself, her attempts to shift blame away from herself seem more pronounced. It's critical we make a careful decision to ensure we eliminate the true threat among us, and I urge everyone to consider how her behavior could be an indication of hidden motives. Let\u2019s discuss this further before we vote."
"Dracula : I believe we need to carefully analyze the behavior of both Semira and Ileana regarding their accusations. While they each point fingers at one another, it's crucial to assess the motivations behind their claims. I suggest we maintain an open dialogue and observe their actions closely before making a final decision on whom to eliminate. Let's ensure our next vote is well-informed to protect the remaining Citizens."
"Semira : I believe we must carefully assess each other's behaviors and motivations before making any hasty decisions. While accusations have been thrown at both Ileana and Dracula, I urge everyone to look closely at the consistency of each player's contributions. Let's keep discussing and gather insights that will lead us to the true threat among us."
"Ileana : I believe we need to focus our suspicions more closely on Semira. While she accuses both Dracula and myself, her behavior seems more calculated, and she\u2019s been directing the conversation away from herself consistently. We must carefully consider her motives and ensure we\u2019re not making a mistake by overlooking her actions. Let\u2019s discuss further before making our final decision."
"Semira : I believe we need to focus our discussions more on both Ileana and Dracula rather than solely targeting me. While accusations have flown around, it\u2019s essential to examine the consistency of their behaviors and contributions. I urge everyone to analyze the motivations behind the claims made by both players before making any hasty decisions. Let\u2019s ensure our next vote is careful and well-informed."
"Ileana : I believe we need to take a closer look at Semira's behavior and the way she has consistently deflected suspicion onto both Dracula and myself. Her strategy seems to be one of misdirection, and we cannot overlook the significance of her actions. I suggest we focus our votes on Semira, as her behavior raises serious concerns about her true intentions. Let\u2019s take a decisive step to ensure that we eliminate the true threat among us."
