Mafia Game Rules:

1. The game consists of two teams: the Mafia and the Citizens(Police, Doctor, Citizen).
2. Each player has a role: Mafia, Doctor, Police, or Citizen.
3. The game alternates between two phases: Day and Night.
4. The game continues until the Victory Conditions are met.
5. Each player should keep their role secret and try to blend in if they are Mafia.

Victory Conditions:
   - Citizens win if all Mafia members are eliminated.
   - Mafia wins if they outnumber the remaining Citizens.

Day Phase:
   1. Starting from the second day, it is announced who was eliminated during the previous night.
	- If someone was eliminated, the system reveals the player's team (Mafia, Citizen) to everyone.
	- If no players were eliminated, the system announces that no one was eliminated.  
   2. All players discuss who they believe is part of the Mafia.
	- The system randomly selects a player to initiate the discussion.
	- When a player speaks, they must specify the player(s) they are addressing (excluding themselves), and may address multiple players if desired.
	- The player being addressed can either respond to the speaking player or choose to address a different player.
	- A total number of speaking turns is set, and once this limit is reached, voting will proceed. 
   3. The players vote to eliminate one person from the game based on their suspicions.
  	- The player with the most votes is eliminated.
   	- If multiple candidates receive the highest number of votes, a revote will take place.
   4. The player with the most votes is given a final statement.
   5. After the final statement, each player votes on whether to eliminate the player with the most votes.
   	- If the majority votes for elimination, the player is removed, and their role (Mafia or Citizen) is revealed to everyone.
  	- If the majority votes against elimination, nothing happens, and the game proceeds to the night phase.
   	- If the votes are tied, a revote is conducted.
   6. Check the victory conditions and decide to end the game or not.

Night Phase:
   1. The Mafia secretly selects one person to eliminate each night with fellow Mafia member(s) if any.
	- The Mafia vote on which player they wish to eliminate.
	- If only one player is chosen as a result of the vote, that player is marked for elimination.
	- If multiple players are chosen, the Mafia engage in discussions for a set number of times to decide.
	- After the discussion, a second vote is held to determine the target for elimination.
	- If only one player is chosen in this second vote, that player is marked for elimination.
	- If multiple players are still chosen, one player among them is randomly selected to be marked for elimination.
   2. The Doctor selects one person to protect.
	- The Doctor can choose to protect themselves.
	- If the player the Doctor chooses to protect is the same as the player targeted for elimination by the Mafia, that player will not be eliminated.
   3. The Police selects one person to investigate to see if they are Mafia.
	- Only the police can know the results of the investigation.
