We haven\u2019t lost anyone yet, but it feels like there might be tension brewing among us.

"Larisa's Strategy: As a Citizen, my strategy is to engage in discussions without being overly aggressive. I will focus on observing players' reactions, especially those who defend themselves or others too much, as it might indicate Mafia involvement. I'll actively participate in voting and share my suspicions thoughtfully, while also subtly supporting potential key roles like the Doctor and Police.

"Lucian's Strategy: As Lucian, my strategy will focus on blending in with the Citizens while subtly diverting suspicion.

Alexia claims to be the Doctor, highlighting her role in protecting Citizens.

Notably, there's a sense of trust among Citizens, but Alexia's role makes her a significant target. The need for strategic selections is crucial, as well as subtle manipulation to blend"
"Lucian's Strategy: Target Alexia for elimination. As the Doctor, she poses the biggest threat to the Mafia by protecting Citizens. During the Day Phase, subtly encourage others to focus on players like Larisa or Mircea to divert suspicion away from myself and Vladimir. Blend in by expressing confusion about who the Mafia could be, while steering discussions away from our actions. By eliminating the Doctor, we weaken the Citizens significantly, increasing our chances of victory."
"Lucian's Final Utterance: Alexia"
"Vladimir's Summary: As Vladimir, I've noted that the Citizens are proactive in discussing strategy and roles. Alexia has revealed herself as the Doctor, making her a prime target to consider eliminating. The discussions are quite collaborative, but there's a strong sense of unity among the Citizens. Larisa, Semira, Lucian, and Mircea all emphasize working together, which might make them suspicious of anyone who doesn't align with that. I need to choose a target wisely to maintain our position without drawing attention."
"Vladimir's Strategy: As Vladimir, I will target Alexia, the Doctor, to eliminate. By removing her, we can reduce the Citizens' chances of survival and prevent any potential protection against future Mafia attacks. Given her prominent role, this will also create confusion and fear among the other Citizens, making it easier for us to steer suspicion towards others while maintaining our cover as trustworthy players. This strategic elimination will be crucial for advancing the Mafia's position in the game."

"system : Lucian selected Alexia, Vladimir selected Alexia"
"Alexia's Summary: So far, all players have introduced themselves as Citizens, emphasizing teamwork to identify Mafia members. Notably, I, Alexia, secretly hold the role of Doctor, which I must keep concealed to avoid becoming a target. The eagerness shown by everyone to collaborate raises the possibility of Mafia attempting to blend in among us. I need to monitor behavior closely, especially during discussions, to identify any suspicious actions or alliances that may emerge. My first protection decision will be critical to safeguarding a valuable player."
"Alexia's Strategy: As Alexia, I will prioritize protecting a player who seems eager to discuss and collaborate, as they may hold valuable insights. I will observe the behaviors during the discussions closely and select the Police if their identity is suspected, as their investigative power could be crucial. If not, I will choose a player who stands out positively and seems to be actively engaged, avoiding self-protection to ensure other Citizens remain safe. It's important to act strategically while staying under the radar."
